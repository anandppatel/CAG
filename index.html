<h2 id="org94c27c0"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Affine sets, the Zariski topology, and Hilbert's Nullstellensatz</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Affine varieties are the fundamental building blocks of <i>quasi-projective varieties</i>, the central objects of study in classical algebraic geometry.  In essence, an affine variety is the  solution set of a system of polynomial equations \[f_1(x_1, \dots, x_n) = f_2(x_1, \dots, x_n) = \dots =f_{m}(x_1, \dots, x_n) = 0\] with coefficients in some field \(\k\). This solution set is made into a geometric object after we introduce  the <i>Zariski topology</i> on it.  Furthermore, two such solutions sets are allowed to communicate with each other only through a restricted class of functions, called <i>regular maps</i>.  Setting things up this way allows us to define what it means for two solution sets to be isomorphic, even though they may arise in totally different contexts.  (Much like in group theory, the notion of homomorphism and isomorphism allows us to extract an abstract group from its  various guises.)  An affine variety \(X\) is then basically an equivalence class of solution sets under the notion of regular isomorphism.  It turns out that \(X\) is uniquely recoverable from the ring of <i>regular functions</i> on it.  This ring is called its  <i>coordinate ring</i>, denoted \(\k[X]\).  The basic philosophy in affine algebraic geometry is then to translate "geometric notions" about \(X\) into ring-theoretic notions about \(\k[X]\), thereby supporting our geometric intuitions with rigorous algebra.
</p>

<p>
The relationship between the originating system of equations and its solution set is cleanest and makes most intuitive sense when the <i>ground field</i> \(\k\) is algebraically closed, and the main theorem(s) describing this relationship is Hilbert's Nullstellensatz in its various incarnations. This theorem is the most important piece of commutative algebra allowing us to set up the theory of affine varieties.  Because algebraic geometry is easiest to understand when \(\k\) is algebraically closed, we will assume this throughout.  (Later, we will see that the characteristic \(0\) situation is especially nice, but for now algebraic closed-ness is all we assume.)

<h3 id="org02dedd8"><span class="section-number-3">1.1.</span> Affine sets</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
We begin by defining the central geometric objects of this chapter.
</p>

<div class="definition" id="org0039370">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b><i>Affine space of dimension \(n\) (over \(\k\))</i></b>, denoted \[\A^{n}_{\k}\] is the set of \(n\) -tuples \(p = (p_1, \dots, p_{n})\), \(p_{i} \in \k\).</li>
<li>For each \(i\), we denote by \[x_{i}: \A^{n}_{\k} \to \A^{1}_{\k}\] the \(i\)-th coordinate function sending \((p_{1}, \dots, p_{n})\) to \(p_i\).</li>
<li>If \(S \subset \k[x_{1} \dots, x_n]\) is a subset of polynomials, we define the <b><i>vanishing set of \(S\)</i></b> to be
\[\V(S) = \big\{p \in \A^n_{\k} \mid f(p)=0 \, \textrm{for all}\, f \in S \big\}.\]</li>
<li>A subset \(U \subset \A^{n}_{\k}\) is a <b><i>Zariski open set</i></b> if its complement is \(\V(S)\) for some \(S \subset \k[x_1, \dots, x_n]\).</li>
<li>Conversely, any subset \(Z \subset \A^n_{\k}\) of the form \(\V(S)\) is called a <b><i>Zariski closed</i></b> (or, simply <b><i>closed</i></b>) subset. A Zariski closed subset of affine space also called an <b><i>affine (or algebraic) set</i></b>.</li>
<li>More generally, if \(Z \subset \A^n_{\k}\) is an algebraic set, then a subset \(U \subset Z\) is  a <b><i>Zariski open  subset of \(Z\)</i></b> if \(U\) is the intersection of \(Z\) with a Zariski open subset of \(\A^n_{\k}\).</li>
<li>A Zariski open subset of an algebraic set is called a <b><i>quasi-affine set</i></b>.</li>
</ol>

</div>

<p>
It is immediate that if \(S \subset \k[x_1, \dots, x_n]\) is any subset, and if \(I\) is the ideal generated by \(S\), then \(\V(S) = \V(I)\).  So, our focus quickly moves to ideals in \(\k[x_1, \dots, x_n]\).  The following exercise justifies the use of the words "closed/open."  
</p>


<div class="exercise" id="org7c18cf0">
<p>
Suppose \(I,J \subset \k[x_1, \dots, x_n]\) are two ideals. Show:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>\(\V(I \cdot J) = \V(I) \cup \V(J)\), and</li>
<li>\(\V(I+J) = \V(I) \cap \V(J).\)</li>
<li>Prove that two distinct ideals \(I\) and \(J\) can satisfy \(\V(I) = \V(J)\), and moreover, there exists an example where neither \(I \subset J\) nor \(J \subset I\).</li>
<li>Prove that the Zariski open subsets of \(\A^{n}_{\k}\) satisfy the axioms of a topology. This topology is called the <b><i>Zariski topology on \(\A^n_{\k}\).</i></b></li>
<li>Prove that the Zariski closed, proper subsets of \(\A^{1}_{\k}\) are precisely the finite subsets.</li>
<li>Prove that every finite subset of \(\A^{n}_{\k}\) is closed, but that the converse is false when \(n \geq 2\).</li>
<li>If \(Z \subset \A^n_{\k}\) is an affine set, prove that the subsets of \(Z\) which are closed in \(\A^n_{\k}\) satisfy the axioms satisfied by closed sets in a topology. This is called the <b><i>Zariski topology on \(Z\).</i></b></li>
</ol>

</div>

<p>
In light of this exercise, in order to create an algebraic set, we need only consider \(\V(I)\)'s for <i>ideals</i> \(I \subset \k[x_1, \dots,
x_n]\).    Whenever we say "open" or "closed", we refer to the Zariski topology. 
</p>


<p>
The beauty in classical algebraic geometry is only seen through its countless, interesting examples.   Certain examples are more educational than others and have special names.  Here are a few to start:
</p>



<div class="eg" id="org801a7d4">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The <i>parabola</i> \[\V(y-x^{2}) \subset \A^{2}_{\k}.\]</li>
<li>The <i>quadric cone</i> \[\V(xy-z^2) \subset \A^3_{\k}.\]</li>
<li><p>
An  <i>affine quadric surface</i> \[\V(xy-z) \subset \A^{3}_{\k}.\]
</p>


<div id="org6bc945a" class="figure">

<li>A particular  <i>elliptic curve</i> \[\V(y^2-x^3+x) \subset \A^2_{\k}.\]</li>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-org6a0a58f" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org6a0a58f"><span class="section-number-4">1.1.1.</span> Pictures</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-1">
<p>
In the list of examples above, what do those pictures mean?  Clearly they are real images, meaning they exist in \(\A^2_{\R}\) or \(\A^{3}_{\R}\). But this is not our true context: we've assumed \(\k\) is algebraically closed!  Unfortunately, it is not possible to draw a true representation in this case, so we refer to these sorts of images as "real cartoons."   
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3b35d03" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org3b35d03"><span class="section-number-4">1.1.2.</span> Operations \(\V\) and \(\I\)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-2">
<p>
The operation \(\V\) is a surjective  function: \[\V(-): \big\{\,\textrm{ideals in} \,\,  \k[x_1, \dots, x_n] \big\} \to \big\{\,\textrm{affine subsets of} \,\,  \A^{n}_{\k} \big\}.\]
</p>

<p>
But we can also go backwards, from sets to ideals:
</p>

<div class="definition" id="org999db59">
<p>
Let \(Z \subset \A^n_{\k}\) be any subset.  We define the <b><i>ideal of \(Z\)</i></b> to be \[\I(Z) = \big\{ f \in \k[x_1,\dots,x_n] \mid f(z)=0\,\, \textrm{for all}\,\,z \in Z \big\}.\]
</p>

</div>

<p>
And so, \(\I\) defines a function:
 \[\I(-): \big\{\,\textrm{affine subsets of} \,\,  \A^{n}_{\k} \big\} \to \big\{\,\textrm{ideals in}  \subset \k[x_1, \dots, x_n] \big\}.\]
</p>

<div class="eg" id="org45e69cc">
<p>
Let \(p = (p_1, \dots, p_n) \in \A^n_{\k}\) be any point. Then \(\I(\{p\}) = (x_1-p_1, \dots, x_n-p_n)\). Notice that \(\I(\{p\}) \subset \k[x_1,\dots, x_n]\) is a <i>maximal ideal</i>.  So, we typically use the symbol \(\fm_p\) for this ideal.
</p>

</div>


<p>
\(\I(-)\) satisfies some obvious properties, for example if \(Z_1 \subset Z_2\) is a proper containment of affine subsets, then we get a strict, opposite containment of ideals \(\I(Z_2) \supset \I(Z_1)\). 
</p>


<p>
Since \(\V\) and \(\I\) point in opposite directions, it's natural to wonder that their compositions (both ways) are.  One composition, found in the next exercise, is easy to understand.  The other composition leads naturally to  Hilbert's Nullstellansatz, and so we postpone it.
</p>

<div class="exercise" id="org66aaf74">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Prove: For any subset \(Z \subset \A^{n}_{\k}\), we have \(Z \subset \V(\I(Z))\).</li>
<li>Prove:  \(Z \subset \A^n_{\k}\) is Zariski-closed if and only if \(Z = \V(\I(Z))\).</li>
<li>In fact, prove: For any \(Z \subset \A^n_{\k}\), \(\V(\I(Z))\) is the closure of \(Z\) under the Zariski topology on \(\A^n_{\k}\).</li>
<li>Prove: If \(Z_1\) and \(Z_2\) are affine sets, then \(\I(Z_1 \cup Z_2) = \I(Z_1) \cap \I(Z_2)\).  (Careful: Is \(\I(Z_1 \cap Z_2) = \I(Z_1) + \I(Z_2)\)?)</li>
<li>Disprove: If \(Z_1, Z_2\) are two affine sets, then \(\I(Z_1) \cup \I(Z_2) = \I(Z_1) \cdot \I(Z_2)\).</li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-3">
<p>
Affine sets have their "main, big  pieces," called <i>irreducible components</i>.   For instance, in the irreducible components of the  <i>line and plane</i> \(\V(xz,yz) \subset \A^{3}_{\k}\) are the line \(\V(x,y)\) and the plane \(\V(z)\). To make this concept precise, we borrow the  notion of <i>reducibility</i> from topology, which we elaborate on here.  
</p>

<div class="definition" id="org439b365">
<p>
An affine set \(Z\) is <b><i>reducible</i></b> if it is the union of two non-empty, proper closed subsets. Otherwise, \(Z\) is said to be <b><i>irreducible</i></b>.  More generally, a topological space \(X\) is <b><i>reducible</i></b> if it is the union of two non-empty, proper closed subsets, and is <b><i>irreducible</i></b> otherwise.
</p>

<p>
If \(X\) is any topological space, then a subset \(Y \subset X\) is called an <b><i>irreducible component</i></b> of \(X\) if \(Y\) is maximal among closed, irreducible subsets of \(X\). 
</p>

</div>

<div class="exercise" id="org3d9239a">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Prove: Any two non-empty open subsets of an irreducible topological space must intersect.</li>
<li>Prove: If \(U \subset X\) is a non-empty open set in an irreducible topological space \(X\), then \(X\) is the closure of \(U\), i.e. \(U\) is dense in \(X\).</li>
<li>Suppose \(X\) is a topological space, and \(A,B \subset X\) are proper closed subsets satisfying \(X = A \cup B\).  Prove: If \(A\) is also irreducible, then \(A\) is in fact an irreducible component of \(X\).</li>
</ol>

</div>

<p>
Our next proposition says that for affine sets, irreducibility has a

An affine set \(Z \subset \A^{n}_{\k}\) is irreducible if and only if \(\I(Z) \subset \k[x_1, \dots, x_n]\) is a prime ideal.
</p>

</div>

<div class="proof" id="org9ba7c3f">
<p>
First assume \(Z\) is an irreducible affine set, and \(f,g \in \k[x_1, \dots, x_n]\) satisfy \(fg \in \I(Z)\), and \(f \notin \I(Z)\). Then, \(fg \in \I(Z)\) implies \(Z = (\V(f) \cap Z) \cup (\V(g) \cap Z).\) And \(f \notin \I(Z)\) implies \(\V(f) \cap Z \neq Z.\) Thus, by irreducibility we deduce \(\V(g) \cap Z = Z\), i.e. \(g \in \I(Z)\). So \(\I(Z)\) is prime.
</p>

<p>
Next assume \(Z = A \cup B\) with \(A, B\) both proper closed subsets of \(Z\). In particular, \(A\) is not contained in \(B\) and vice versa. Therefore, there exists a polynomial \(f\) vanishing on \(A\) but not entirely on \(B\) and a polynomial \(g\) vanishing on \(B\) but not entirely on \(A\). Then \(fg \in \I(Z)\), yet neither \(f\) nor \(g\) is in \(\I(Z)\).  So \(\I(Z)\) is not prime.

Our first fundamental  theorem, which appears in several different forms in several different levels of generality, explains the relationship between the operations \(\V(-)\) and \(\I(-)\).  The exact message of Hilbert's Nullstellensatz can be confusing for newcomers, so I'll try to give many different viewpoints here.  The theorem will also play an important role in laying the foundation for the concept of regular functions.

<p>
Here are two popular ways of thinking about the Nullstellensatz: 
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>When \(\k\) is algebraically closed, the Nullstellensatz says that the only way for \(\V(I)\) to be empty is if \(I = (1)\), the unit ideal. In other words, any system of polynomial equations which is not equivalent to \(1=0\) <b><i>must have</i></b> solutions in \(\A^n_{\k}\).</li>
<li>When \(\k\) is algebraically closed, the Nullstellensatz provides the precise list of <i>maximal ideals in</i> \(\k[x_1, \dots, x_n]\): it says that every maximal ideal is of the form \(\fm_{p}\) for some point \(p \in \A^{\k}\).</li>

Next, we must fix the mechanism by which algebraic sets and quasi-affine sets  communicate with each other.  This will also allow us to talk about a quasi-affine set without reference to an ambient \(\A^{n}_{\k}\).

We say \(f: U \to \A^{1}_{\k}\) is regular if it is regular at every point \(z \in U\).

<p>
If \(U \subset \A^{n}_{\k}\) is a quasi-affine set, then there is a very quick way to produce regular functions on \(U\): restrict a polynomial \(f(x_1, \dots, x_n)\) to \(U\). Therefore, we always have a ring homomorphism \(\k[x_1, \dots, x_n] \to \k[U]\).  Secondly, clearly if \(f \in \I(U)\), then \(f\) restricts to the zero function \(0 \in \k[U]\).  Therefore, restriction of polynomials induces a homomorphism \[\k[x_1, \dots, x_n]/\I(U) \to \k[U].\]  One fundamental use of the Nullstellensatz provides great news in the case that \(U \subset \A^{n}_{\k}\) is <i>affine</i>.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
If \(X\) is a quasi-affine set, then for each open set \(U \subset X\) we may consider the ring of regular functions \(\k[U]\) defined on \(U\).  In this way, \(X\) defines an entire constellation of rings, namely the \(\k[U]\)'s, and these rings have natural <i>restriction maps</i> among some of them: If \(V \subset U\) is an inclusion of open sets, then each regular function on \(U\) can be restricted to a regular function on \(V\), giving a map \(\rho_{U,V}: \k[U] \to \k[V]\).  If \(W \subset V \subset U\) is a sequence of inclusions, then the two intermediate restriction maps compose to \(\rho_{U,W}\), obviously.
</p>

<p>
The constellation of rings and restriction maps has a further property: If \[\{U_{\alpha}\}, \alpha \in A\] is an open cover of an open set \(U \subset X\), then the natural product of restriction maps \[\rho: \k[U] \to \prod_{\alpha \in A}\k[U_{\alpha}]\] is injective, and its image is precisely the set of tuples \((f_{\alpha})_{\alpha \in A}\) satisfying <i>compatibility</i> \[f_{\alpha}|_{U_{\alpha} \cap U_{\beta}} = f_{\beta}|_{U_{\alpha} \cap U_{\beta}}\] for all \(\alpha, \beta \in A\).

<p>
The term for this sort of assignment \(\big\{\,\textrm{open sets in }
\,\, X \big\} \to \big\{\,\textrm{Rings} \big\}\) is a <i>sheaf of
\(\k\)-algebras</i>.  Typically, this assignment is denoted \(\O_{X}\), and
is sometimes called the <i>sheaf of regular functions on \(X\)</i>, or other
times called the <i>structure sheaf</i> of \(X\). For each open set \(U\),
\(\O_{X}(U)\) is simply the ring \(\k[U]\).  Modern algebraic geometry
takes the perspective that the true objects of study are certain kinds of
<i>pairs</i> \((X,\O_{X})\) where \(X\) is a an abstract topological space and
\(\O_{X}\) a sheaf of rings on \(X\).  We will not need that perspective right now &#x2013; this is just meant to bridge what we do here with what you might see later.

Some geometric notions are <i>local</i>, in that they describe the geometry "around" a given point,  and some geometric notions are <i>global</i>, describing some aspect of the entire geometry of a (quasi-)affine variety \(X\).

\(\O_{X,p}\) is the ring of <i>germs</i> of functions regular at \(p\). A
<i>germ</i> is an equivalence class of pairs \((f,U)\) where \(U\) is an open

The unique maximal ideal of \(\O_{X,p}\) is denoted \(\fm_{p} \subset \O_{X,p}\).

For a multitude of reasons, it is useful to want to <i>compactify</i> affine space.  Take, for instance, the concept of the <i>slope of a line</i> from high school algebra.  Slopes were numbers, typically labelled \(m\).  Except, hold on, what about those pesky "vertical" lines?  It is clear that, geometrically, vertical lines are no more special than any other kind of line.  So we should extend the concept of slope \(m\) to include an "infinity" slope \(m =\infty\). By adding \(\infty\) to the \(\A^1\) of slopes, we arrive at the <i>projective line</i> \(\P^1\).

Another way that projective space arises is in the following context:  We have a vector space \(V\), but we only really care  about elements of \(V\) <i>up to scaling</i>.

Our first, most important objective is to understand how closed subsets of \(\P^{n}_{\k}\) are specified.  The formula is very simple.  First, observe that if \(F(x_0, \dots, x_n) \in \k[x_0, \dots, x_n]\) is a <i>homogeneous</i> polynomial, then the vanishing set \[\V(F) := \{[p_0: \dots : p_n] \in \P^{n}_{\k} \mid F(p_0, \dots, p_n) = 0\}\] is <i>well-defined</i>.

Such a \(\V(F) \subset \P^{n}_{\k}\) will be called a  <i>hypersurface</i> much like in the affine case.  A general closed subset is simply the common vanishing set of a <i>system of homogeneous polynomials</i>, \(\V(F_1, \dots, F_m)\) where each \(F_i\) is a homogeneous polynomial in \(x_0, \dots, x_n\) of some degree \(d_i \geq 0\).

<p>
The ideal \((F_i , \dots, F_m) \subset \k[x_0, \dots, x_n]\) is a special kind of ideal, called a <i>graded ideal</i>.  To explain this concept, recall that an arbitrary polynomial \(f \in \k[x_0, \dots, x_n]\) breaks up into a sum of its <i>graded parts</i> \[f = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} f_{i}\] where each \(f_i\) is homogeneous of degree \(i\).

<div class="theorem" id="org4c069a0">
<p>
Every closed subset of  \(\P^{n}_{\k}\) is obtained as the vanishing set of a graded ideal in \(\k[X_0, \dots, X_n]\). 
</p>

</div>


<div class="proof" id="org6070071">
<p>
The fact that such a set is closed is immediate from definitions, so we skip that direction.  Now suppose \(Z \subset \P^{n}_{\k}\) is a <i>non-empty</i> closed set, meaning \(\q^{-1}(Z) \subset (\A^{n+1}_{\k})^{\times}\) is Zariski-closed.  By the definition of the induced topology, there is a Zariski-closed set \(\widehat{Z} \subset \A^{n+1}_{\k}\) such that \(\widehat{Z} \cap (\A^{n+1}_{\k})^{\times} = \q^{-1}(Z)\).  Since \(Z\) is non-empty, there exists a point \((p_0, \dots, p_{n}) \in \q^{-1}(Z)\), and hence \((\lambda p_0, \dots, \lambda p_{n}) \in \q^{-1}(Z)\) for all \(\lambda \in \k^{\times}\). It follows that \(\widehat{Z}\) is a <i>conical subset</i> of \(\A^{n+1}_{\k}\).  A Zariski-closed subset \(C \subset \A^{n+1}_{\k}\) is  <i>conical</i>, or a <i>cone</i>, if \((p_0 ,\dots, p_n) \in C\) if and only if \((\lambda p_{0}, \dots, \lambda p_{n}) \in C\) for all \(\lambda \in \k^{\times}\).
</p>

<p>
It suffices to show that the ideal of a conical set \(C \subset \A^{n+1}_{\k}\) is homogeneous.  Indeed, for sake of contradiction, suppose \(f \in \I(C)\) is a polynomial of least degree whose graded parts are <i>not</i> all contained in \(\I(C)\). Write \[f = f_0 + \dots + f_{d},\] the decomposition into graded pieces, where \(f_d\) is assumed nonzero. As \(C\) is conical, the polynomial \(f(\lambda x_0, \dots, \lambda x_n)\) is also in \(\I (C)\) for all \(\lambda \in \k^{\times}\). This latter polynomial is \[f_0 + \lambda f_{1} + \dots + \lambda^{d} f_{d}.\] Subtracting this from \(\lambda^{d}f\) yields \((\lambda^{d} - 1) f_0 + (\lambda^{d}-\lambda) f_{1} + \dots + (\lambda^{d}-\lambda^{d-1}) f_{d-1} \in \I(C)\). The numbers \(\lambda^{d}-\lambda^{i}\) are not all zero for all \(\lambda \in \k^{\times}\) because \(\k\) is an infinite field. (It is algebraically closed!)  So, this latter polynomial's graded parts are all in \(\I(C)\), meaning \(f_i\), \(i < d\) are all in \(\I(C)\).  But then, so is \(f_{d}\), contradicting the assumption on \(f\).
</p>

<p>
So, \(\I(\widehat{Z})\) is homogeneous, which is what we needed to show.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-1-2">
<p>
The projective line \(\P^{1}_{\k}\) is ubiquitous, and understanding its geometry is absolutely essential.  
</p>

<div class="proposition" id="orgc29c8c2">
<p>
The closed subsets of  \(\P^{1}_{\k}\) are the finite subsets and \(\P^{1}_{\k}\) itself.
</p>

<div class="exercise" id="orgf24b132">
<p>
Prove the proposition.
</p>

</div>

<p>
The projective line \(\P^{1}_{\k}\) is the union of its two affine charts \(U_{0}\) and \(U_{1}\), both identified with the affine line \(\A^{1}_{\k}\).   \(U_{0}\) is the set of points of the form \([1 : p_{1/0}]\) as \(p_{1/0}\) ranges freely in \(\A^{1}_{\k}\), and \(U_1\) is the set of points of the form \([p_{0/1}:1]\) as \(p_{0/1}\) varies freely in \(\A^{1}_{\k}\).  \(U_0\) and \(U_1\) overlap on the points of the form \(p = [p_0 : p_1]\) where both \(p_0\) and \(p_1\) are nonzero elements in \(\k\).  Such a point \(p\) may be viewed as a point of either chart: in the \(U_0\)-chart it corresponds to the value \(p_{1/0} = \frac{p_{1}}{ p_{0}}\) and in the the \(U_1\)-chart it corresponds to the value \(p_{0/1} = \frac{p_0}{p_1}\).   Thus, since we are describing the same point of \(\P^{1}_{\k}\), we deduce that the affine coordinate \(x_{1/0}\) on \(U_0\) is related to the affine coordinate \(x_{0/1}\) on \(U_1\) via the <i>transition</i> or <i>gluing</i> data: \[x_{1/0} = \frac{1}{x_{0/1}}.\]
</p>

<p>
This transition data only exists and is meaningful on the intersection \(U_0 \cap U_1\). Indeed, both \(x_{0/1}, x_{1/0}\) must be nonzero to parse it.   When the charts \(U_i\) are identified with \(\A^{1}_{\k}\), we conclude that <i>\(\P^{1}_{\k}\) is obtained by gluing together two \(\A^{1}_{\k}\)'s along \(\A^{1}_{\k} \setminus \{0\}\) where the identification is by inversion.</i> (Recall in complex analysis, where sometimes we make a change of variables \(w = 1/z\) when investigating the behavior of a holomorphic function when the argument becomes arbitrarily large. We are actually doing analysis on the <i>Riemann sphere</i> \(\P^{1}_{\mathbb{C}}\), where most of the class occurred in one affine chart.)

<p>
It is a good practice to start thinking about the notion of "set of all closed subsets of an algebraic-geometric object".  We will do so in case of \(\P^{1}_{\k}\). 
</p>

<p>
Every closed subset of \(\P^{1}_{\k}\) is the vanishing set of a homogeneous polynomial \(F(x_0,x_1)\) of some degree \(d\) in homogeneous coordinates \(x_0,x_{1}\), i.e. a degree \(d\) <i>binary form</i>. The set \(S_d\) of all degree \(d\) binary forms naturally forms a \(\k\)-vector space of dimension \(d+1\): specifically, every form can be written
\[ F = a_0 x_{0}^d + a_1 x_{0}^{d-1}x_{1} + \dots + a_d x_{1}^d \] where \(a_i \in \k\) are arbitrary.  The \(0\) form obviously does not define a closed <i>strict</i> subset of \(\P^1_{\k}\).  Furthermore, the form \(F\) and \(\lambda F\) define the same closed subset.  Therefore, as a first pass at geometrizing the "set of all closed subsets of \(\P^{1}_{\k}\) we can begin with the <i>projective space of degree \(d\) binary forms</i> \[\P S_d.\]  Here, if \(V\) is any vector space, we denote its <i>projectivization</i> \(V^{\times}/\k^{\times}\) by \(\P V\). It is isomorphic to \(\P^{n}\) where \(\dim V = n+1\).
</p>

<p>
A point of \(\P S_d\) is written \([a_0 : \dots : a_d]\), and <i>corresponds to</i> or <i>means</i> the binary form \(\sum_{i}a_{i}x_{0}^{d-i}x_{1}^{i}\), up to scaling.  We will let \(c_i\), \(i \in \{0, \dots, d\}\) denote the homogeneous coordinates on \(S_d\) sending \((a_0, \dots, a_d)\) to \(a_i\).   Notice that \(\P S_d\) is identifiable with \(\P^d\), but the current context <i>gives each point a meaning</i>.   When \(\P^d\) is interpreted as \(\P S_d\) it comes to life with beautiful geometric figures inside it:

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-1-4">
<p>
Next, we should explore the geometry of the projective plane \(\P^{2}_{\k}\).  It has three standard affine charts \(U_0, U_1, U_2\).  The affine chart \(U_{0}\) is the set of points of the form \([1:p_{1/0}:p_{2/0}]\). The affine chart \(U_{1}\) is the set of points of the form \([p_{0/1}:1:p_{2/1}]\).  A point \([p_0 : p_1: p_2]\) is in \(U_0 \cap U_1\) if and only if both \(p_0\) and \(p_1\) are nonzero.  In this case, when we scale down the respective factors to \(1\), we find that \(p_{0/1} = p_{0}/p_{1}\) while \(p_{1/0} = p_{1}/p_{0}\).  Therefore, on \(U_{0} \cap U_{1}\) we have the transition data between affine coordinates: \[x_{1/0} = x_{0/1}^{-1}.\]  Furthermore, for the point \(p\) above, we have \(p_{2/1} = p_{2}/p_{1}\) and \(p_{2/0} = p_{2}/p_{0}\). Thus, on \(U_{0} \cap U_{1}\) we obtain the further transition data: \[x_{2/1}x_{1/0} = x_{2/0}.\]
</p>

<p>
Let us now consider a specific projective subset  \(C \subset \P^{2}_{\k}\): the <i>conic curve</i> \[\V(x_{0}x_{2}-x_{1}^{2}).\]   Let us see what the three "affine sides" \[C_{i} := C \cap U_{i}\] of this curve look like.  For \(C_0\), we simply set \(x_0 = 1\) in the defining equation \(x_0 x_2 - x_{1}^{2}\), and interpret the remaining variables as \(x_{1/0}\) and \(x_{2/0}\).  We thus get \[\V(x_{2/0} - x_{1/0}^{2}) \subset U_{0} \simeq \A^{2}_{\k}.\]  This is a "parabola" in the \((x_{1/0}, x_{2/0})\) coordinates.  The "points at infinity" for \(C_0\) can simply be taken to mean the points of \(C \setminus C_{0}\).  There is only one such point: To find it, we set \(x_0 = 0\) in the original homogeneous equation.  We then obtain a homogeneous form only in the variables \(x_1, x_2\), namely \(x_{1}^{2} = 0\).  This defines a closed subset of the \(\P^{1}_{\k}\) "at infinity" consisting of the points in \(\P^{2}_{\k}\) of the form \([0:p_{1}:p_{2}]\).  The equation \(x_{1}^{2}=0\) defines the single point \([0:0:1]\) on this \(\P^{1}_{\k}\) at infinity.  (Observe that the equation obtained was \(x_{1}^{2}=0\), not just \(x_{1}=0\). This reflects the fact that the line at infinity (from \(U_0\)'s perspective) meets the conic \(C\) <i>tangentially</i> at the point \([0:0:1]\), but we don't know what that means quite yet.)
</p>

<p>
The chart \(C_1\) is given by affine equation \(x_{0/1}x_{2/1}-1 = 0\).  This is a "hyperbola".  There are two points "at infinity" for \(C_1\), namely \([0:0:1]\) and \([1:0:0]\).  These correspond to the two asymptotes of the hyperbola.   Finally, the chart \(C_2\) is again a "parabola".  The lesson here, and the reason I put quotation marks around these words, is that the notion of hyperbola, parabola, and ellipse are illusions in the projective setting.  The conic \(C\) <i>is one cohesive object</i>, and these distinctions arise when we look at \(C\) from different sides.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
Now that we have defined the more general concept of a projective (or quasi-projective) set \(X \subset \P^{n}_{\k}\) we must move toward establishing the mechanisms which relate two of them, much as we did in the chapter on affine varieties.  The situation is a bit more complicated than it was for affine sets, essentially because projective sets have many "sides" to deal with, making their anatomy slightly more complicated.  
</p>

<p>
First we will define what a regular function on a quasi-projective set \(X \subset \P^{n}\) means.  The idea is to inherit the meaning of regular function from quasi-affine subsets of \(\A^{n+1}_{\k}\):
</p>

<div class="definition" id="orgf00e874">
<p>
Let \(X \subset \P^{n}\) be a quasi-projective set. A function \[f:X \to \A^{1}_{\k}\] is <b><i>regular</i></b> if for each point \(x \in X\) there exists an open neighborhood \(U \subset X\) of \(x\) such that the composite \(f|_{U} \circ \q : \q^{-1}(U) \to \A^{1}_{\k}\) is a regular function on the quasi-affine set \(\q^{-1}(U) \subset \A^{n+1}_{\k}\).
</p>

</div>

<p>
One important difference between the affine and projective stories is that homogeneous variables \(x_0, \dots, x_n\) or homogeneous polynomials thereof are do not produce well-defined functions on projective space.  However, by taking <i>ratios</i> of two homogeneous forms \[\frac{F(x_0, \dots, x_n)}{G(x_0, \dots, x_n)}\] <b><i>of the same degree</i></b>, one obtains a function, not defined on all of \(\P^{n}_{\k}\) but defined on the open subset \[\P^{n}_{\k} \setminus \V(G).\]  We will call a ratio of homogeneous polynomials of the same degree a <b><i>homogeneous ratio</i></b>.
</p>

<p>
The next exercise provides an alternative definition of regular function.
</p>

<div class="exercise" id="org7098e19">
<p>
Let \(X \subset \P^{n}_{\k}\) be a quasi-projective set.  Prove that a function \(f: X \to \A^{1}_{\k}\) is regular if and only if \(f\) is locally expressible as a homogeneous ratio, i.e. for each \(x \in X\) there is an open neighborhood \(U \subset X\) such that \(f|_{U}\) is equal to a homogeneous ratio \(F(x_0, \dots, x_n)/G(x_0, \dots, x_n)\) with \(G\) nonzero on \(U\). 
</p>

</div>


<p>
Regular functions can be added and multiplied to obtain another regular function.  Constant functions are regular. Thus, the set of all regular functions on \(X\) is a \(\k\)-algebra, denoted \(\k[X]\) as in the affine situation.  However, as we will see, the ring \(\k[X]\) usually carries very little information about \(X\), and certainly does not recover \(X\) in most cases where \(X\) is projective.
</p>

<p>
Regularity, however, is evidently a local condition on \(X\). Therefore, we obtain a sheaf of regular functions denoted \(\O_X\), whose value \(\O_{X}(U)\) on an open subset \(U\) is the ring \(\k[U]\). 
</p>

<div class="exercise" id="orgd0d0ca0">
<p>
In this exercise we will establish that \(\k[\P^n_{\k}] = \k\), i.e. the only regular functions on projective space are constant. (If you are struggling, just do the case of \(\P^{1}_{\k}\).)
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Prove: If \(X \subset \P^n_{\k}\) is any quasi-projective set, then the restriction of a regular function to an open subset \(U \subset X\) is again regular.</li>
<li>Prove that the regular functions on the standard affine open chart \(U_i \subset \P^{n}_{\k}\) are exactly the polynomials in the variables \(x_{j/i}\), \(j \in \{0 ,\dots, n\} \setminus \{i\}\).</li>
<li>If \(f \in \P^{n}_{\k}\) is a regular function, and if \(f_i = f|_{U_{i}}\), then clearly \(f_{i}|_{U_{i}\cap U_{j}} = f_{j}|_{U_{i} \cap U_{j}}\). Use this, and the transition data between charts to prove the theorem!</li>
<li>In fact, prove that \(\k[U_i \cup U_j] = \k\), where \(U_i\) and \(U_j\) are any two standard affine charts on \(\P^{n}_{\k}\).</li>
</ol>

</div>

<p>
As before, once we have the notion of a single regular function, we automatically obtain the definition of a regular mapping \(f: X \to \A^{n}_{\k}\) for any \(n\) by requesting that each coordinate function be regular.
</p>

<div class="exercise" id="orgb7e27c3">
<p>
A regular mapping \(f: X \to \A^{n}_{\k}\) is continuous for the Zariski topologies on domain and codomain.
</p>

</div>

<p>
The question of how to define a <i>regular mapping</i>  \(\varphi: X \to Y\) between two quasi-projective sets \(X\) and \(Y\) has two types of answers.  The best, most "mature" answer is in terms of sheaves, which will be given later.  The clunkier, but more vivid "first" answer is as follows.  
</p>

<p>
First, if \(Y \subset \P^{n}_{\k}\) we replace the question with the more specific question: What is a regular mapping \(\varphi: X \to \P^{n}_{\k}\)? Once this is answered, we simply insist that the image of \(\varphi\) lie inside \(Y\).  The more specific answer is: For each standard affine open \(U_{i} \subset \P^{n}_{\k}\), request that \(V_{i} := \varphi^{-1}(U_i)\) is open and that the restriction \[\varphi|_{V_{i}} : V_{i} \to U_{i} \simeq \A^{n}_{\k}\] is regular, as already defined before. 
</p>

<div class="exercise" id="org45c8840">
<p>
Prove that a regular mapping \(\varphi: X \to \P^{n}_{\k}\) is continuous for the Zariski topology, i.e. that the preimage of <i>any</i> open set (not just the \(U_{i}\)) is open. Using this, prove that the composite of regular mappings \(\varphi: X \to Y\) and \(\psi: Y \to Z\) is again regular.
</p>

</div>

<p>
The modern way to define a regular mapping (both in the affine case and in the projective case) is as follows: A function \(\varphi: X \to Y\) is regular if: 1) \(\varphi\) is continuous for Zariski topologies, and 2) For any open set \(U \subset Y\) and any regular function \(g \in \O_{Y}(U)\), the composite function \[\varphi^{\sharp}(g) := g \circ \varphi|_{\varphi^{-1}(U)}: \varphi^{-1}(U) \to \A^{1}_{\k}\] is a regular function on \(\varphi^{-1}(U)\).  In the language of sheaves, this second point is summarized as: the "composition with \(\varphi\)" induces a morphism of sheaves on \(X\) \[\varphi^{\sharp}: \varphi^{-1}\O_{Y} \to \O_{X}.\]
