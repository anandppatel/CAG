<h2 id="org61c0993"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Affine sets, the Zariski topology, and Hilbert's Nullstellensatz</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Affine varieties are the fundamental building blocks of <i>quasi-projective varieties</i>, the central objects of study in classical algebraic geometry.  In essence, an affine variety is the  solution set of a system of polynomial equations \[f_1(x_1, \dots, x_n) = f_2(x_1, \dots, x_n) = \dots =f_{m}(x_1, \dots, x_n) = 0\] with coefficients in some field \(\k\). This solution set is made into a geometric object after we introduce  the <i>Zariski topology</i> on it.  Furthermore, two such solutions sets are allowed to communicate with each other only through a restricted class of functions, called <i>regular maps</i>.  Setting things up this way allows us to define what it means for two solution sets to be isomorphic, even though they may arise in totally different contexts.  (Much like in group theory, the notion of homomorphism and isomorphism allows us to extract an abstract group from its  various guises.)  An affine variety \(X\) is then basically an equivalence class of solution sets under the notion of regular isomorphism.  It turns out that \(X\) is uniquely recoverable from the ring of <i>regular functions</i> on it.  This ring is called its  <i>coordinate ring</i>, denoted \(\k[X]\).  The basic philosophy in affine algebraic geometry is then to translate "geometric notions" about \(X\) into ring-theoretic notions about \(\k[X]\), thereby supporting our geometric intuitions with rigorous algebra.
</p>

<p>
The relationship between the originating system of equations and its solution set is cleanest and makes most intuitive sense when the <i>ground field</i> \(\k\) is algebraically closed, and the main theorem(s) describing this relationship is Hilbert's Nullstellensatz in its various incarnations. This theorem is the most important piece of commutative algebra allowing us to set up the theory of affine varieties.  Because algebraic geometry is easiest to understand when \(\k\) is algebraically closed, we will assume this throughout.  (Later, we will see that the characteristic \(0\) situation is especially nice, but for now algebraic closed-ness is all we assume.)

<h3 id="org95fa6f9"><span class="section-number-3">1.1.</span> Affine sets</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
We begin by defining the central geometric objects of this chapter.
</p>

<div class="definition" id="org555ac31">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b><i>Affine space of dimension \(n\) (over \(\k\))</i></b>, denoted \[\A^{n}_{\k}\] is the set of \(n\) -tuples \(p = (p_1, \dots, p_{n})\), \(p_{i} \in \k\).</li>
<li>For each \(i\), we denote by \[x_{i}: \A^{n}_{\k} \to \A^{1}_{\k}\] the \(i\)-th coordinate function sending \((p_{1}, \dots, p_{n})\) to \(p_i\).</li>
<li>If \(S \subset \k[x_{1} \dots, x_n]\) is a subset of polynomials, we define the <b><i>vanishing set of \(S\)</i></b> to be
\[\V(S) = \big\{p \in \A^n_{\k} \mid f(p)=0 \, \textrm{for all}\, f \in S \big\}.\]</li>
<li>A subset \(U \subset \A^{n}_{\k}\) is a <b><i>Zariski open set</i></b> if its complement is \(\V(S)\) for some \(S \subset \k[x_1, \dots, x_n]\).</li>
<li>Conversely, any subset \(Z \subset \A^n_{\k}\) of the form \(\V(S)\) is called a <b><i>Zariski closed</i></b> (or, simply <b><i>closed</i></b>) subset. A Zariski closed subset of affine space also called an <b><i>affine (or algebraic) set</i></b>.</li>
<li>More generally, if \(Z \subset \A^n_{\k}\) is an algebraic set, then a subset \(U \subset Z\) is  a <b><i>Zariski open  subset of \(Z\)</i></b> if \(U\) is the intersection of \(Z\) with a Zariski open subset of \(\A^n_{\k}\).</li>
<li>A Zariski open subset of an algebraic set is called a <b><i>quasi-affine set</i></b>.</li>
</ol>

</div>

<p>
It is immediate that if \(S \subset \k[x_1, \dots, x_n]\) is any subset, and if \(I\) is the ideal generated by \(S\), then \(\V(S) = \V(I)\).  So, our focus quickly moves to ideals in \(\k[x_1, \dots, x_n]\).  The following exercise justifies the use of the words "closed/open."  
</p>


<div class="exercise" id="orgeb4e17e">
<p>
Suppose \(I,J \subset \k[x_1, \dots, x_n]\) are two ideals. Show:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>\(\V(I \cdot J) = \V(I) \cup \V(J)\), and</li>
<li>\(\V(I+J) = \V(I) \cap \V(J).\)</li>
<li>Prove that two distinct ideals \(I\) and \(J\) can satisfy \(\V(I) = \V(J)\), and moreover, there exists an example where neither \(I \subset J\) nor \(J \subset I\).</li>
<li>Prove that the Zariski open subsets of \(\A^{n}_{\k}\) satisfy the axioms of a topology. This topology is called the <b><i>Zariski topology on \(\A^n_{\k}\).</i></b></li>
<li>Prove that the Zariski closed, proper subsets of \(\A^{1}_{\k}\) are precisely the finite subsets.</li>
<li>Prove that every finite subset of \(\A^{n}_{\k}\) is closed, but that the converse is false when \(n \geq 2\).</li>
<li>If \(Z \subset \A^n_{\k}\) is an affine set, prove that the subsets of \(Z\) which are closed in \(\A^n_{\k}\) satisfy the axioms satisfied by closed sets in a topology. This is called the <b><i>Zariski topology on \(Z\).</i></b></li>
</ol>

</div>

<p>
In light of this exercise, in order to create an algebraic set, we need only consider \(\V(I)\)'s for <i>ideals</i> \(I \subset \k[x_1, \dots,
x_n]\).    Whenever we say "open" or "closed", we refer to the Zariski topology. 
</p>


<p>
The beauty in classical algebraic geometry is only seen through its countless, interesting examples.   Certain examples are more educational than others and have special names.  Here are a few to start:
</p>



<div class="eg" id="orgf69da7c">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The <i>parabola</i> \[\V(y-x^{2}) \subset \A^{2}_{\k}.\]</li>
<li>The <i>quadric cone</i> \[\V(xy-z^2) \subset \A^3_{\k}.\]</li>
<li><p>
An  <i>affine quadric surface</i> \[\V(xy-z) \subset \A^{3}_{\k}.\]
</p>


<div id="org747eed0" class="figure">

<li>The <i>cuspidal cubic</i> \[\V(y^2-x^3) \subset \A^2_{\k}.\]</li>
<li>A particular  <i>elliptic curve</i> \[\V(y^2-x^3+x) \subset \A^2_{\k}.\]</li>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2864f8f" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org2864f8f"><span class="section-number-4">1.1.1.</span> Pictures</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-1">
<p>
In the list of examples above, what do those pictures mean?  Clearly they are real images, meaning they exist in \(\A^2_{\R}\) or \(\A^{3}_{\R}\). But this is not our true context: we've assumed \(\k\) is algebraically closed!  Unfortunately, it is not possible to draw a true representation in this case, so we refer to these sorts of images as "real cartoons."   
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2da1148" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org2da1148"><span class="section-number-4">1.1.2.</span> Operations \(\V\) and \(\I\)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-2">
<p>
The operation \(\V\) is a surjective  function: \[\V(-): \big\{\,\textrm{ideals in} \,\,  \k[x_1, \dots, x_n] \big\} \to \big\{\,\textrm{affine subsets of} \,\,  \A^{n}_{\k} \big\}.\]
</p>

<p>
But we can also go backwards, from sets to ideals:
</p>

<div class="definition" id="orga79eb31">
<p>
Let \(Z \subset \A^n_{\k}\) be any subset.  We define the <b><i>ideal of \(Z\)</i></b> to be \[\I(Z) = \big\{ f \in \k[x_1,\dots,x_n] \mid f(z)=0\,\, \textrm{for all}\,\,z \in Z \big\}.\]
</p>

</div>

<p>
And so, \(\I\) defines a function:
 \[\I(-): \big\{\,\textrm{affine subsets of} \,\,  \A^{n}_{\k} \big\} \to \big\{\,\textrm{ideals in}  \subset \k[x_1, \dots, x_n] \big\}.\]
</p>

<div class="eg" id="org7f37d18">
<p>
Let \(p = (p_1, \dots, p_n) \in \A^n_{\k}\) be any point. Then \(\I(\{p\}) = (x_1-p_1, \dots, x_n-p_n)\). Notice that \(\I(\{p\}) \subset \k[x_1,\dots, x_n]\) is a <i>maximal ideal</i>.  So, we typically use the symbol \(\fm_p\) for this ideal.
</p>

</div>


<p>
\(\I(-)\) satisfies some obvious properties, for example if \(Z_1 \subset Z_2\) is a proper containment of affine subsets, then we get a strict, opposite containment of ideals \(\I(Z_2) \supset \I(Z_1)\). 
</p>


<p>
Since \(\V\) and \(\I\) point in opposite directions, it's natural to wonder that their compositions (both ways) are.  One composition, found in the next exercise, is easy to understand.  The other composition leads naturally to  Hilbert's Nullstellansatz, and so we postpone it.
</p>

<div class="exercise" id="org345667d">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Prove: For any subset \(Z \subset \A^{n}_{\k}\), we have \(Z \subset \V(\I(Z))\).</li>
<li>Prove:  \(Z \subset \A^n_{\k}\) is Zariski-closed if and only if \(Z = \V(\I(Z))\).</li>
<li>In fact, prove: For any \(Z \subset \A^n_{\k}\), \(\V(\I(Z))\) is the closure of \(Z\) under the Zariski topology on \(\A^n_{\k}\).</li>
<li>Prove: If \(Z_1\) and \(Z_2\) are affine sets, then \(\I(Z_1 \cup Z_2) = \I(Z_1) \cap \I(Z_2)\).  (Careful: Is \(\I(Z_1 \cap Z_2) = \I(Z_1) + \I(Z_2)\)?)</li>
<li>Disprove: If \(Z_1, Z_2\) are two affine sets, then \(\I(Z_1) \cup \I(Z_2) = \I(Z_1) \cdot \I(Z_2)\).</li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-3">
<p>
Affine sets have their "main, big  pieces," called <i>irreducible components</i>.   For instance, in the irreducible components of the  <i>line and plane</i> \(\V(xz,yz) \subset \A^{3}_{\k}\) are the line \(\V(x,y)\) and the plane \(\V(z)\). To make this concept precise, we borrow the  notion of <i>reducibility</i> from topology, which we elaborate on here.  
</p>

<div class="definition" id="org4f04ed5">
<p>
An affine set \(Z\) is <b><i>reducible</i></b> if it is the union of two non-empty, proper closed subsets. Otherwise, \(Z\) is said to be <b><i>irreducible</i></b>.  More generally, a topological space \(X\) is <b><i>reducible</i></b> if it is the union of two non-empty, proper closed subsets, and is <b><i>irreducible</i></b> otherwise.
</p>

<p>
If \(X\) is any topological space, then a subset \(Y \subset X\) is called an <b><i>irreducible component</i></b> of \(X\) if \(Y\) is maximal among closed, irreducible subsets of \(X\). 
</p>

</div>

<div class="exercise" id="org507d6cc">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Prove: Any two non-empty open subsets of an irreducible topological space must intersect.</li>
<li>Prove: If \(U \subset X\) is a non-empty open set in an irreducible topological space \(X\), then \(X\) is the closure of \(U\), i.e. \(U\) is dense in \(X\).</li>
<li>Suppose \(X\) is a topological space, and \(A,B \subset X\) are proper closed subsets satisfying \(X = A \cup B\).  Prove: If \(A\) is also irreducible, then \(A\) is in fact an irreducible component of \(X\).</li>
</ol>

</div>

<p>
Our next proposition says that for affine sets, irreducibility has a

An affine set \(Z \subset \A^{n}_{\k}\) is irreducible if and only if \(\I(Z) \subset \k[x_1, \dots, x_n]\) is a prime ideal.
</p>

</div>

<div class="proof" id="org5770407">
<p>
First assume \(Z\) is an irreducible affine set, and \(f,g \in \k[x_1, \dots, x_n]\) satisfy \(fg \in \I(Z)\), and \(f \notin \I(Z)\). Then, \(fg \in \I(Z)\) implies \(Z = (\V(f) \cap Z) \cup (\V(g) \cap Z).\) And \(f \notin \I(Z)\) implies \(\V(f) \cap Z \neq Z.\) Thus, by irreducibility we deduce \(\V(g) \cap Z = Z\), i.e. \(g \in \I(Z)\). So \(\I(Z)\) is prime.
</p>

<p>
Next assume \(Z = A \cup B\) with \(A, B\) both proper closed subsets of \(Z\). In particular, \(A\) is not contained in \(B\) and vice versa. Therefore, there exists a polynomial \(f\) vanishing on \(A\) but not entirely on \(B\) and a polynomial \(g\) vanishing on \(B\) but not entirely on \(A\). Then \(fg \in \I(Z)\), yet neither \(f\) nor \(g\) is in \(\I(Z)\).  So \(\I(Z)\) is not prime.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
Our first fundamental  theorem, which appears in several different forms in several different levels of generality, explains the relationship between the operations \(\V(-)\) and \(\I(-)\).  The exact message of Hilbert's Nullstellensatz can be confusing for newcomers, so I'll try to give many different viewpoints here.  The theorem will also play an important role in laying the foundation for the concept of regular functions.

<p>
Here are two popular ways of thinking about the Nullstellensatz: 
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>When \(\k\) is algebraically closed, the Nullstellensatz says that the only way for \(\V(I)\) to be empty is if \(I = (1)\), the unit ideal. In other words, any system of polynomial equations which is not equivalent to \(1=0\) <b><i>must have</i></b> solutions in \(\A^n_{\k}\).</li>
<li>When \(\k\) is algebraically closed, the Nullstellensatz provides the precise list of <i>maximal ideals in</i> \(\k[x_1, \dots, x_n]\): it says that every maximal ideal is of the form \(\fm_{p}\) for some point \(p \in \A^{\k}\).</li>

Next, we must fix the mechanism by which algebraic sets and quasi-affine sets  communicate with each other.  This will also allow us to talk about a quasi-affine set without reference to an ambient \(\A^{n}_{\k}\).

We say \(f: U \to \A^{1}_{\k}\) is regular if it is regular at every point \(z \in U\).

<p>
If \(U \subset \A^{n}_{\k}\) is a quasi-affine set, then there is a very quick way to produce regular functions on \(U\): restrict a polynomial \(f(x_1, \dots, x_n)\) to \(U\). Therefore, we always have a ring homomorphism \(\k[x_1, \dots, x_n] \to \k[U]\).  Secondly, clearly if \(f \in \I(U)\), then \(f\) restricts to the zero function \(0 \in \k[U]\).  Therefore, restriction of polynomials induces a homomorphism \[\k[x_1, \dots, x_n]/\I(U) \to \k[U].\]  One fundamental use of the Nullstellensatz provides great news in the case that \(U \subset \A^{n}_{\k}\) is <i>affine</i>.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
If \(X\) is a quasi-affine set, then for each open set \(U \subset X\) we may consider the ring of regular functions \(\k[U]\) defined on \(U\).  In this way, \(X\) defines an entire constellation of rings, namely the \(\k[U]\)'s, and these rings have natural <i>restriction maps</i> among some of them: If \(V \subset U\) is an inclusion of open sets, then each regular function on \(U\) can be restricted to a regular function on \(V\), giving a map \(\rho_{U,V}: \k[U] \to \k[V]\).  If \(W \subset V \subset U\) is a sequence of inclusions, then the two intermediate restriction maps compose to \(\rho_{U,W}\), obviously.
</p>

<p>
The constellation of rings and restriction maps has a further property: If \[\{U_{\alpha}\}, \alpha \in A\] is an open cover of an open set \(U \subset X\), then the natural product of restriction maps \[\rho: \k[U] \to \prod_{\alpha \in A}\k[U_{\alpha}]\] is injective, and its image is precisely the set of tuples \((f_{\alpha})_{\alpha \in A}\) satisfying <i>compatibility</i> \[f_{\alpha}|_{U_{\alpha} \cap U_{\beta}} = f_{\beta}|_{U_{\alpha} \cap U_{\beta}}\] for all \(\alpha, \beta \in A\).

<p>
The term for this sort of assignment \(\big\{\,\textrm{open sets in }
\,\, X \big\} \to \big\{\,\textrm{Rings} \big\}\) is a <i>sheaf of
\(\k\)-algebras</i>.  Typically, this assignment is denoted \(\O_{X}\), and
is sometimes called the <i>sheaf of regular functions on \(X\)</i>, or other
times called the <i>structure sheaf</i> of \(X\). For each open set \(U\),
\(\O_{X}(U)\) is simply the ring \(\k[U]\).  Modern algebraic geometry
takes the perspective that the true objects of study are certain kinds of
<i>pairs</i> \((X,\O_{X})\) where \(X\) is a an abstract topological space and
\(\O_{X}\) a sheaf of rings on \(X\).  We will not need that perspective right now &#x2013; this is just meant to bridge what we do here with what you might see later.

Some geometric notions are <i>local</i>, in that they describe the geometry "around" a given point,  and some geometric notions are <i>global</i>, describing some aspect of the entire geometry of a (quasi-)affine variety \(X\).

\(\O_{X,p}\) is the ring of <i>germs</i> of functions regular at \(p\). A

follows: \((f,U)\) is equivalent to \((g,V)\) if there exists an open
neighborhood \(W \subset U \cap V\) of \(p\) such that \(f|_{W} = g|_{W}\).

The unique maximal ideal of \(\O_{X,p}\) is denoted \(\fm_{p} \subset \O_{X,p}\).

<p>
For a multitude of reasons, it is useful to want to <i>compactify</i> affine space.  Take, for instance, the concept of the <i>slope of a line</i> from high school algebra.  Slopes were numbers, typically labelled \(m\).  Except, hold on, what about those pesky "vertical" lines?  It is clear that, geometrically, vertical lines are no more special than any other kind of line.  So we should extend the concept of slope \(m\) to include an "infinity" slope \(m =\infty\). By adding \(\infty\) to the \(\A^1\) of slopes, we arrive at the <i>projective line</i> \(\P^1\).
</p>

<p>
Another way that projective space arises is in the following context:  We have a vector space \(V\), but we only really care  about elements of \(V\) <i>up to scaling</i>.  For instance, if we only care about the <i>location of the roots</i> of a quadratic polynomial \(ax^2+bx+c\), then for our purposes there is no difference between polynomials \(ax^2+bx+c\) and \(\lambda a x^2 + \lambda b x + \lambda c =0\), where \(\lambda\) a nonzero number.

Our first, most important objective is to understand how closed subsets of \(\P^{n}_{\k}\) are specified.  The formula is very simple.  First, observe that if \(F(x_0, \dots, x_n) \in \k[x_0, \dots, x_n]\) is a <i>homogeneous</i> polynomial, then the vanishing set \[\V(F) := \{[p_0: \dots : p_n] \in \P^{n}_{\k} \mid F(p_0, \dots, p_n) = 0\}\] is <i>well-defined</i>.  (Remember, projective space is a set of equivalence classes, so we have to make sure definitions are actually well-defined.)  Such a \(\V(F) \subset \P^{n}_{\k}\) will be called a  <i>hypersurface</i> much like in the affine case.  A general closed subset is simply the common vanishing set of a <i>system of homogeneous polynomials</i>, \(\V(F_1, \dots, F_m)\) where each \(F_i\) is a homogeneous polynomial in \(x_0, \dots, x_n\) of some degree \(d_i \geq 0\).
</p>

<p>
The ideal \((F_i ,dots, F_m) \subset \k[x_0, \dots, x_n]\) is a special kind of ideal, called a <i>graded ideal</i>.  To explain this concept, recall that an arbitrary polynomial \(f \in \k[x_0, \dots, x_n]\) breaks up into a sum of its <i>graded parts</i> \[f = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} f_{i}\] where each \(f_i\) is homogeneous of degree \(i\).

<div class="theorem" id="org670acb5">
<p>
Every closed subset of  \(\P^{n}_{\k}\) is obtained as the vanishing set of a graded ideal in \(\k[X_0, \dots, X_n]\). 
</p>

</div>


<div class="proof" id="orga0db8e3">
<p>
The fact that such a set is closed is immediate from definitions, so we skip that direction.  Now suppose \(Z \subset \P^{n}_{\k}\) is a <i>non-empty</i> closed set, meaning \(\q^{-1}(Z) \subset (\A^{n+1}_{\k})^{\times}\) is Zariski-closed.  By the definition of the induced topology, there is a Zariski-closed set \(\widehat{Z} \subset \A^{n+1}_{\k}\) such that \(\widehat{Z} \cap (\A^{n+1}_{\k})^{\times} = \q^{-1}(Z)\).  Since \(Z\) is non-empty, there exists a point \((p_0, \dots, p_{n}) \in \q^{-1}(Z)\), and hence \((\lambda p_0, \dots, \lambda p_{n}) \in \q^{-1}(Z)\) for all \(\lambda \in \k^{\times}\). It follows that \(\widehat{Z}\) is a <i>conical subset</i> of \(\A^{n+1}_{\k}\).  A Zariski-closed subset \(C \subset \A^{n+1}_{\k}\) is  <i>conical</i>, or a <i>cone</i>, if \((p_0 ,\dots, p_n) \in C\) if and only if \((\lambda p_{0}, \dots, \lambda p_{n}) \in C\) for all \(\lambda \in \k^{\times}\).
</p>

<p>
It suffices to show that the ideal of a conical set \(C \subset \A^{n+1}_{\k}\) is homogeneous.  Indeed, for sake of contradiction, suppose \(f \in \I(C)\) is a polynomial of least degree whose graded parts are <i>not</i> all contained in \(\I(C)\). Write \[f = f_0 + \dots + f_{d},\] the decomposition into graded pieces, where \(f_d\) is assumed nonzero. As \(C\) is conical, the polynomial \(f(\lambda x_0, \dots, \lambda x_n)\) is also in \(\I (C)\) for all \(\lambda \in \k^{\times}\). This latter polynomial is \[f_0 + \lambda f_{1} + \dots + \lambda^{d} f_{d}.\] Subtracting this from \(\lambda^{d}f\) yields \((\lambda^{d} - 1) f_0 + (\lambda^{d}-\lambda) f_{1} + \dots + (\lambda^{d}-\lambda^{d-1}) f_{d-1} \in \I(C)\). The numbers \(\lambda^{d}-\lambda^{i}\) are not all zero for all \(\lambda \in \k^{\times}\) because \(\k\) is an infinite field. (It is algebraically closed!)  So, this latter polynomial's graded parts are all in \(\I(C)\), meaning \(f_i\), \(i < d\) are all in \(\I(C)\).  But then, so is \(f_{d}\), contradicting the assumption on \(f\).
</p>

<p>
So, \(\I(\widehat{Z})\) is homogeneous, which is what we needed to show.

<li>For each \(i=0,\ldots, n\), let \(\gamma_i: \A^{n}_{\k} \to U_i\) denote the bijective function that sends \((a_0, \ldots, a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}, \ldots a_n)\) to the point \([a_0: \ldots: a_{i-1} : 1 : a_{i+1} : \ldots : a_n]\).  Prove that \(\gamma_i\) is a <i>homeomorphism</i> of topological spaces, meaning: \(Y \subset \A^n_{\k}\) is Zariski-open if and only if \(\gamma_i(Y) \subset U_i\) is Zariski-open.</li>
<li>One could define another topology on \(\P^n_{\k}\) in the following way: A set \(Y \subset \P^n_{\k}\) is closed if and only if \(Y_{i} := Y \cap U_i\) is closed in \(U_i\) for all \(i\), where we think of \(U_i\) as an affine space under the indentifications \(\gamma_i\) in the previous exercise.  Prove that this topology is the same as the Zariski topology defined in the definition above.</li>
