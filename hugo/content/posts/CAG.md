## Affine space \\(\A^n\_{\k}\\), algebraic subsets, and the Zariski topology {#affine-space-a-n-k-algebraic-subsets-and-the-zariski-topology}

Affine varieties are the fundamental building blocks of the objects in classical algebraic geometry, _quasi-projective varieties_.  In essence, an affine variety is the  solution set of a system of polynomial equations with coefficients in some field \\(\k\\). This solution set is made into a geometric object when we introduce a topology, the _Zariski topology_, on it.  Furthermore, two such solutions sets are allowed to communicate with each other using only a restricted class of functions, called **_regular maps_**.  Using this, we are then able to codify what it means for two solution sets to be "the same", even though they may arise in totally different contexts.  (Much like in group theory, the notion of homomorphism and isomorphism allows us to witness the same abstract group in various guises.)  An affine variety \\(X\\) is then defined to be an equivalence class of solution sets under the notion of regular isomorphism, and it turns out that \\(X\\) is uniquely recoverable from the ring of regular functions on it, called the _coordinate ring_, denoted \\(\k[X]\\).  The basic philosophy in affine algebraic geometry is then to translate "geometric notions" about \\(X\\) into ring-theoretic notions about \\(\k[X]\\), thereby securing geometric intuitions in the rigorous realm of algebra.

The relationship between the originating system of equations and the solution set is tightest when this _ground field_ \\(\k\\) is algebraically closed, and the main theorem(s) describing this relationship is Hilbert's Nullstellensatz in its various incarnations.


### Algebraic sets {#algebraic-sets}

<div class="definition">

1.  **_Affine space of dimension \\(n\\) (over \\(\k\\))_**, denoted \\[\A^{n}\_{\k}\\] is the set of \\(n\\) -tuples \\(p = (p\_1, \dots, p\_{n})\\), \\(p\_{i} \in \k\\).
2.  For each \\(i\\), we denote by \\[x\_{i}: \A^{n}\_{\k} \to \A^{1}\_{\k}\\] the \\(i\\)-th coordinate function sending \\((p\_{1}, \dots, p\_{n})\\) to \\(p\_i\\).
3.  If \\(S \subset \k[x\_{1} \dots, x\_n]\\) is a subset of polynomials, we define the **_vanishing set of \\(S\\)_** to be
    \\[\V(S) = \big\\{p \in \A^n\_{\k} \mid f(p)=0 \\, \textrm{for all}\\, f \in S \big\\}.\\]
4.  A subset \\(U \subset \A^{n}\_{\k}\\) is a **_Zariski open set_** if its complement is \\(\V(S)\\) for some \\(S \subset \k[x\_1, \dots, x\_n]\\).
5.  Conversely, any subset \\(Z \subset \A^n\_{\k}\\) of the form \\(\V(S)\\) is called a **_Zariski closed_** (or, simply **_closed_**) subset. A Zariski closed subset of affine space also called an **_algebraic set_**.
6.  More generally, if \\(Z \subset \A^n\_{\k}\\) is an algebraic set, then a subset \\(U \subset Z\\) is  a **_Zariski open  subset of \\(Z\\)_** if \\(U\\) is the intersection of \\(Z\\) with a Zarski open subset of \\(\A^n\_{\k}\\).
7.  A Zariski open subset of an algebraic set is called a **_quasi-affine set_**.

</div>

The reason for the terminology is: The Zariski open/closed sets satisfy the axioms of a topology.  Whenever we say "open" or "closed" in the context of algebraic sets, we refer to the Zariski topology.

<div class="eg">

Some algebraic sets are more famous than others (for various reasons), and have names.

1.  The _parabola_ \\[\V(y-x^{2}) \subset \A^{2}\_{\k}.\\]
2.  The _quadric cone_ \\[\V(xy-z^2) \subset \A^3\_{\k}.\\]
3.  The _hyperboloid of one sheet_ \\[\V(xy-z) \subset \A^{3}\_{\k}.\\]
4.  The _nodal cubic_ \\[\V(y^2 - x^{2}-x^{3}) \subset \A^2\_{\k}.\\]
5.  The _cuspidal cubic_ \\[\V(y^2-x^3) \subset \A^2\_{\k}.\\]
6.  An / elliptic curve/ \\[\V(y^2-x^3+x) \subset \A^2\_{\k}.\\]
7.  The _affine twisted cubic_ \\[\V(x^2-y,x^3-z) = \V(x^2-y, xy-z) \subset \A^3\_{\k}.\\]
8.  The _Whitney umbrella_ \\[\V(x^2+zy^2) \subset \A^{3}\_{\k}.\\]

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/whitney2.png" >}}

1.  A _line and a plane_  \\[\V(xz,yz) \subset \A^3\_{\k}.\\]

</div>

<div class="exercise">

Suppose \\(I,J \subset \k[x\_1, \dots, x\_n]\\) are two ideals. Show:

1.  \\(\V(I \cdot J) = \V(I) \cup \V(J)\\), and
2.  \\(\V(I+J) = \V(I) \cap \V(J).\\)
3.  Prove that two distinct ideals \\(I\\) and \\(J\\) can satisfy \\(\V(I) = \V(J)\\), and moreover, there exists an example where neither \\(I \subset J\\) nor \\(J \subset I\\).
4.  Prove that the Zariski open subsets of \\(\A^{n}\_{\k}\\) satisfy the axioms of a topology. This topology is called the **_Zariski topology on \\(\A^n\_{\k}\\)._**
5.  Prove that the Zariski closed subsets of \\(\A^{1}\_{\k}\\) are the finite sets.
6.  If \\(S \subset \k[x\_1, \dots, x\_n]\\) is a subset, and if \\(\langle S \rangle\\) denotes the ideal generated by \\(S\\), then prove that \\(\V(S) = \V(\langle S \rangle)\\).
7.  Prove that every finite subset of \\(\A^{n}\_{\k}\\) is closed, but that the converse is not true for all \\(n \geq 2\\).

</div>

In light of this exercise, in order to create an algebraic set, we need only consider \\(\V(I)\\)'s for _ideals_ \\(I \subset \k[x\_1, \dots,
x\_n]\\).

And so, the operation \\(\V\\) therefore provides a surjective function: \\[\V(-): \big\\{\\,\textrm{ideals} \\,\\, I \subset \k[x\_1, \dots, x\_n] \big\\} \to \big\\{\\,\textrm{algebraic sets} \\,\\, X \subset \A^{n}\_{\k} \big\\}.\\]

We can also go backwards, from sets to ideals:

<div class="definition">

Let \\(Z \subset \A^n\_{\k}\\) be any subset.  We define the **_ideal of \\(Z\\)_** to be \\[I(Z) = \big\\{ f \in \k[x\_1,\dots,x\_n] \mid f(z)=0\\,\\, \textrm{for all}\\,\\,z \in Z \big\\}.\\]

</div>

<div class="eg">

Let \\(p = (p\_1, \dots, p\_n) \in \A^n\_{\k}\\) be any point. Then \\(I(\\{p\\}) = (x\_1-p\_1, \dots, x\_n-p\_n)\\). Notice that \\(I(\\{p\\}) \subset \k[x\_1,\dots, x\_n]\\) is a _maximal ideal_.  So, we typically use the symbol \\(\fm\_p\\) for this ideal.

</div>

<div class="exercise">

1.  Prove: For any subset \\(Z \subset \A^{n}\_{\k}\\), we have \\(Z \subset \V(I(Z))\\).
2.  Prove:  \\(Z \subset \A^n\_{\k}\\) is Zariski-closed if and only if \\(Z = \V(I(Z))\\).
3.  In fact, prove: For any \\(Z \subset \A^n\_{\k}\\), \\(\V(I(Z))\\) is the closure of \\(Z\\) under the Zariski topology on \\(\A^n\_{\k}\\).

</div>


### Regular functions {#regular-functions}

Next, we must set the rules for how algebraic sets and quasi-affine sets are allowed to communicate with each other. In short, we allow ourselves, to the extent that it is possible, to use functions which are describable using polynomials and their ratios.  These functions are called regular functions.

<div class="definition">

Let \\(U \subset Z\\) be an open subset of an algebraic set.

1.  A function \\(f: U \to \A^1\_{\k}\\) is **_regular_** if: for every \\(x \in U\\), the function \\(f\\) agrees with a ratio of polynomials \\(p/q\\) (with \\(q(x) \neq 0\\)) on some open subset \\(V \subset U\\) containing \\(x\\). The ring of regular functions on \\(U\\) is denoted \\(\k[U]\\).
2.  A map \\(\varphi = (f\_1, \dots, f\_m): U \to \A^m\_{\k}\\) is **_regular_** if each coordinate function \\(f\_i\\) is in \\(\k[U]\\).
3.  If \\(V \subset W\\) is another quasi-affine set, with \\(W\\) an algebraic subset of \\(\A^m\_{\k}\\), then a **_regular mapping_** \\(\varphi: U \to V\\) is a regular map \\(\varphi: U \to \A^m\_{\k}\\) whose image lies in \\(V\\).

</div>

<div class="proposition">

If \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) are quasi-affine sets, and if \\(\varphi: U \to V\\) is a regular mapping, then \\(\varphi\\) is continuous for the Zariski topologies on \\(U\\) and \\(V\\), i.e. the preimage of any closed set is closed.

</div>

<div class="exercise">

Let \\(\varphi: U \to V\\) be a regular mapping between quasi-affine sets.  Prove:

1.  If \\(g \in \k[V]\\)  then \\(g \circ \varphi \in \k[U]\\).
2.  The formula \\(g \mapsto g \circ \varphi\\) defines a \\(\k\\)-algebra homomorphism \\(\k[V] \to \k[U]\\).
3.  If \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) are affine sets, then, conversely, any homomorphism \\(\k[V] \to \k[U]\\) comes from a regular mapping \\(g: U \to V\\).

</div>

<div class="exercise">

Let \\(Z \subset \A^n\_{\k}\\) be an algebraic subset, and let \\(f \in \k[x\_0, \dots, x\_n]\\) be any polynomial.  If \\(\varphi: Z\_f \to \A^1\_{\k}\\) is a regular function then there exists a polynomial \\(a\\) such that \\(p = a/f^{m}\\) for some \\(m \geq 0\\).

</div>


#### Hilbert's Nullstellensatz {#hilbert-s-nullstellensatz}

Our first fundamental  theorem, which appears in several different forms in several different levels of generality, explains the relationship between the operations \\(\V(-)\\) and \\(I(-)\\).  The exact message of Hilbert's Nullstellensatz can be confusing for newcomers, so I'll try to summarize the situation here:

1.  When \\(\k\\) is algebraically closed, the Nullstellensatz tells us that the only way for \\(\V(I)\\) to be empty is if \\(I = (1)\\), the unit ideal. In other words, any system of polynomial equations which is not equivalent to \\(1=0\\) **_must have_** solutions in \\(\A^n\_{\k}\\).
2.  When \\(\k\\) is algebraically closed, the Nullstellensatz provides the precise list of _maximal ideals in_ \\(\k[x\_1, \dots, x\_n]\\).

<div class="theorem">

Let \\(\k\\) be an arbitrary field.

1.  If \\(L\\) is a finitely generated \\(\k\\)-algebra which is also a field, then \\(L\\) is a finite field extension of \\(\k\\).

2.  A polynomial system of equations \\(\big\\{f\_1=0, f\_2=0, \dots, f\_m =0 \big\\}\\) with \\(f\_i \in \k[x\_1, \dots, x\_n]\\) has a solution in **_some_** \\(\k\\)-algebra if and only if it has a solution \\((\alpha\_1, \dots, \alpha\_n)\\) where each \\(\alpha\_i\\) is algebraic over \\(\k\\).

3.  If \\(\k\\) is algebraically closed, then every maximal ideal of \\(\\,\\,\k[x\_1, \dots, x\_n]\\) is of the form \\((x\_1-p\_1, \dots, x\_n-p\_n)\\) for some \\(p\_i \in \k\\).

4.  If \\(\k\\) is algebraically closed, and if \\(I \subset \k[x\_1, \dots, x\_n]\\) satisfies \\(\V(I) = \emptyset\\), then \\(I = (1)\\), the unit ideal.
5.  If \\(\k\\) is algebraically closed, and if \\(\fp \subset \k[x\_1, \dots, x\_n]\\) is a prime ideal, then \\(I(\V(\fp)) = \fp\\).

</div>

<div class="exercise">

Let \\(\k[x]\\) denote the polynomial ring in one variable, and suppose \\(f\_1, \dots, f\_m \in \k[x]\\) are finitely many polynomials.  Prove that the ring \\(\k[x, \frac{1}{f\_1}, \dots, \frac{1}{f\_m}]\\) is never a field.

</div>

<div class="theorem">

Let \\(Z \subset \A^n\_{\k}\\) be an algebraic set. Then every regular function on \\(Z\\) is the restriction of a polynomial.  Thus, the ring of regular functions on \\(Z\\) is isomorphic to \\(\k[x\_1, \dots, x\_n]/\I(Z)\\).

</div>


#### Some  algebra: finite/integral extensions of rings {#some-algebra-finite-integral-extensions-of-rings}

<div class="definition">

1.  An extension \\(A \subset B\\) of rings is **_an integral extension_** if every element of \\(B\\) satisfies a monic polynomial with coefficients in \\(A\\).

2.  An extension of rings \\(A \subset B\\) is **_finite_** if \\(B\\) is finitely generated as an \\(A\\)-module.

</div>


## Projective space \\(\P^n\_{\k}\\) and projective varieties {#projective-space-p-n-k-and-projective-varieties}

For a multitude of reasons, it is useful to want to _compactify_ affine space.  Take, for instance, the concept of the _slope of a line_ from high school algebra.  Slopes were numbers, typically labelled \\(m\\).  Except, hold on, what about those pesky "vertical" lines?  It is clear that, geometrically, vertical lines are no more special than any other kind of line.  So we should extend the concept of slope \\(m\\) to include an "infinity" slope \\(m =\infty\\). By adding \\(\infty\\) to the \\(\A^1\\) of slopes, we arrive at the _projective line_ \\(\P^1\\).

Another way that projective space arises is in the following context:  We have a vector space \\(V\\), but we only really care  about elements of \\(V\\) _up to scaling_.  For instance, if we only care about the _location of the roots_ of a quadratic polynomial \\(ax^2+bx+c\\), then for our purposes there is no difference between polynomials \\(ax^2+bx+c\\) and \\(\lambda a x^2 + \lambda b x + \lambda c =0\\), where \\(\lambda\\) a nonzero number.


### Projective varieties {#projective-varieties}

For simplicity, we work throughout over an algebraically closed field \\(\k\\).

<div class="definition">

1.  The \\(n\\)-dimensional projective space, denoted \\(\P^n\_{\k}\\), is the set of equivalence classes of points of \\(\left(\A^{n+1}\_{\k}\right)^{\times}\\) under the action of \\(\k^{\times}\\) by scaling.
2.  A point \\(p \in  \P^n\_{\k}\\) is denoted by a tuple \\([p\_0 : p\_1 : \ldots : p\_n]\\), and two tuples \\([p\_0 : p\_1 : \ldots : p\_n]\\) and \\([q\_0 : q\_1 : \dots : q\_n]\\) represent the same point in \\(\P^n\_{\k}\\) if and only if there exists \\(\lambda \in \k^{\times}\\) such that \\(p\_i = \lambda q\_i\\) for all \\(i = 0,\ldots, n\\).
3.  The assignment \\((p\_0, \dots, p\_n) \mapsto [p\_0 : \dots : p\_n]\\) defines the **_quotient mapping_** \\[\q : \left( \A^{n+1}\_{\k}\right)^{\times} \to \P^n\_{\k}.\\]
4.  The **_Zariski topology on \\(\P^n\_{\k}\\)_** is defined as follows: A subset \\(U \subset \P^n\_{\k}\\) is open (resp. closed) if and only if \\(\q^{-1}(U)\\) is Zariski-open (resp. closed) in  \\(\left( \A^{n+1}\_{\k}\right)^{\times}\\).
5.  For each \\(i=0, \ldots, n\\), we define the **_\\(i\\)-th standard affine open chart of \\(\P^n\_{\k}\\)_** to be the open set \\[U\_{i} = \big\\{ [p\_{0}: \ldots : p\_n] \mid p\_i \neq 0 \big\\}.\\]

</div>

<div class="exercise">

1.  For each \\(i=0,\ldots, n\\), let \\(\gamma\_i: \A^{n}\_{\k} \to U\_i\\) denote the bijective function that sends \\((a\_0, \ldots, a\_{i-1}, a\_{i+1}, \ldots a\_n)\\) to the point \\([a\_0: \ldots: a\_{i-1} : 1 : a\_{i+1} : \ldots : a\_n]\\).  Prove that \\(\gamma\_i\\) is a _homeomorphism_ of topological spaces, meaning: \\(Y \subset \A^n\_{\k}\\) is Zariski-open if and only if \\(\gamma\_i(Y) \subset U\_i\\) is Zariski-open.
2.  One could define another topology on \\(\P^n\_{\k}\\) in the following way: A set \\(Y \subset \P^n\_{\k}\\) is closed if and only if \\(Y\_{i} := Y \cap U\_i\\) is closed in \\(U\_i\\) for all \\(i\\), where we think of \\(U\_i\\) as an affine space under the indentifications \\(\gamma\_i\\) in the previous exercise.  Prove that this topology is the same as the Zariski topology defined in the definition above.

</div>

<div class="theorem">

Every closed subset of  \\(\P^{n}\_{\k}\\) is obtained as the vanishing set of a graded ideal in \\(\k[X\_0, \dots, X\_n]\\).

</div>


### Projective morphisms {#projective-morphisms}

<div class="theorem">

The main theorem of elimination theory.

</div>


### Morphisms between projective spaces {#morphisms-between-projective-spaces}

<div class="definition">

Let \\(X, Y\\) be two varieties, with \\(X\\) irreducible. A **_rational map_** from \\(X\\) to \\(Y\\), is an equivalence class of pairs \\((\varphi, U)\\) where:

1.  \\(U \subset X\\) is a non-empty open set, and \\(\varphi: U \to Y\\) is a regular map, and
2.  Two pairs \\((\varphi, U)\\) and \\((\xi, V)\\) are equivalent if there exists an open subset \\(W \subset U \cap V\\) where \\(\varphi|\_{W} = \xi|\_{W}\\).

</div>

<div class="proposition">

Let \\(\varphi: X \dashrightarrow Y\\) be a rational map.  Then there exists a maximal domain of definition, \\(U\_{\textrm{max}} \subset X\\) for \\(\varphi\\), i.e. if \\((\xi,U)\\) represents \\(\varphi\\) then \\(U \subset U\_{\textrm{max}}\\).

</div>

(Proof: For all representatives \\((\xi\_{\alpha}, U\_{\alpha})\\) representing \\(\varphi\\), define \\(U\_{\textrm{max}}\\) to be the union of all \\(U\_\alpha\\). Suppose \\((\xi\_{\alpha}, U\_{\alpha})\\) and \\((\xi\_{\beta}, U\_{\beta})\\) both represent \\(\varphi\\). Then \\(U\_{\alpha} \cap U\_{\beta}\\) is an irreducible quasi-projective variety.  The two regular maps \\(\xi\_{\alpha}|\_{U\_{\alpha} \cap U\_{\beta}}\\) and \\(\xi\_{\beta}|\_{U\_{\alpha} \cap U\_{\beta}}\\) agree on an open set, and therefore agree everywhere.  Thus the \\(\xi\_{\alpha}\\)'s glue together to produce a regular map on \\(U\_{\textrm{max}}\\), which is what we needed.)

<div class="theorem">

Every regular mapping \\(\varphi: \P^n\_{\k} \to \P^m\_{\k}\\) is of the form \\([x\_0, \dots, x\_n] \mapsto [F\_0: \ldots : F\_m]\\) for some homogeneous forms \\(F\_{i}\\) of the same degree, not all sharing a common zero.

</div>

<div class="theorem">

Every regular automorphism of \\(\P^n\_{\k}\\) is a linear change of variables.

</div>


## Tangent spaces {#tangent-spaces}

To each point \\(x\\) on a variety \\(X\\) we attach a \\(k\\)-vector space \\(T\_{X,x}\\), called the **_Zariski tangent space_**.   This vector space unlocks the concept of **_smoothness_** of \\(X\\) at \\(x\\), which is the  algebro-geometric formulation of the intuition that \\(X\\) appears \`\`locally linear" around \\(x\\).

<div class="definition">

Let \\(x \in X\\) be a point on a variety.  The **_Zariski tangent space of \\(X\\) at \\(x\\)_**, denoted \\(T\_{X,x}\\), is the \\(\k\\)-vector space \\[\left( {\fm\_{x}}/{\fm\_{x}^2} \right)^{\vee}.\\]

</div>

The ring \\(\k[\varepsilon]/(\varepsilon^2)\\) provides a sometimes-useful alternate interpretation of the Zariski tangent space.  This is encoded in the following critical exercise.

<div class="exercise">

Let \\(x \in X\\) be a point on a variety. Then there is a canonical identification between \\(T\_{X,x}\\) and the set of $\k$-algebra homomorphisms \\(\phi : \O\_{X,x} \to \k[\varepsilon]/(\varepsilon^2)\\) which send \\(\fm\_{x}\\) into the ideal \\((\varepsilon)\\).

<div class="theorem">

Let \\(f: X \to \P^n\_{\k}\\) be a map from a smooth, quasi-projective variety \\(X\\) to a projective space, and suppose \\(\k\\) is a **_perfect_**, algebraically closed field.  If \\(H \subset \P^n\_{\k}\\) is a Zariski-general hyperplane, then \\(f^{-1}(H) \subset X\\) is a smooth divisor.

</div>


## Constancy of number {#constancy-of-number}

<div class="theorem">

Let \\(f: X \to Y\\) be a finite map, with \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) smooth, irreducible affine varieties over a characteristic zero field. Then the length of every fiber is equal to the degree of \\(f\\). (Degree of extension fields.)

</div>


## Hypersurfaces {#hypersurfaces}

Let \\(X = \V(F) \subset \P^n\_{\k}\\) be a hypersurface, defined by a degree \\(d\\) homogeneous form \\(F(x\_0, \dots, x\_n)\\).   Let \\(p = (p\_0, \ldots, p\_n) \in \left( \A^{n+1} \right)^{\times}\\) be a point such that \\(F(p) = 0\\), and let \\(\hat{X} \subset  \A^{n+1}\\) denote the affine cone over \\(X\\).  Then \\(X\\) is singular at \\([p]\\) if and only if \\(\hat{X}\\) is singular at \\(p\\).


## Basics on vector bundles {#basics-on-vector-bundles}


### The definition of a vector bundle {#the-definition-of-a-vector-bundle}

The concept of a **_vector bundle_** is ubiquitous in mathematics, and captures the idea of a "family of vector spaces parametrized by a base space."  In algebraic geometry, the definition is as follows:

<div class="definition">

Let \\(X\\) be a variety.  A **_rank \\(r\\) vector bundle over \\(X\\)_** is a variety \\(\E\\) together with a regular map \\(\pi: \E \to X\\) such that:

-   There is an open covering \\(\\{U\_{\alpha}\\}\\) of \\(X\\)  and isomorphisms \\(\phi\_{\alpha}: \pi^{-1}(U\_{\alpha}) \to U\_{\alpha}\times \A^r\_{\k}\\) TODO

### Line bundles {#line-bundles}

### Rank-dropping varieties {#rank-dropping-varieties}

Suppose \\(V\\) and \\(W\\) are \\(\k\\)-vector spaces of dimensions \\(n\\), and \\(m\\) respectively.  In this document we will establish fundamental facts about the geometry of a particularly ubiquitous stratification of the vector space of linear homomorphisms \\[\Hom(V,W)\\]

<div class="definition">

For each integer \\(r \leq m\\), we define the subset \\[\mathsf{R}\_{r} \subset \Hom(V,W)\\] as the collection of homomorphisms \\(\varphi: V \to W\\) having rank \\(\leq r\\).  Furthermore, let \\[\mathring{\mathsf{R}}\_{r} = \mathsf{R}\_{r}\setminus \mathsf{R}\_{r-1}\\] be the set of homomorphisms of rank \\(r\\).

</div>

On the extremes, \\(\mathsf{R}\_m = \Hom(V,W)\\) and \\(\mathsf{R}\_{0} = \\{0\\}\\).  After choosing bases of \\(V\\) and \\(W\\), every element of \\(\Hom(V,W)\\) is represented by a \\(m \times n\\) matrix. Let us write the **_universal \\(m \times n\\) matrix_** as
\\[A = \big\\{ x\_{ij} \big\\} \\,\\,\\,  1 \leq i \leq m, 1 \leq j \leq n.\\]
Linear algebra says:

For each \\(r\\), the subset \\(\mathsf{R}\_{r}\\) is the common vanishing locus of all determinants of \\((r+1) \times (r+1)\\) minors of the universal matrix \\(A\\).

Thus, \\(\mathsf{R}\_{r}\\) is a sub-variety of \\(\Hom(V,W)\\).  (In fact, it comes with a "usual" scheme structure given by the ideal in \\(\k\left[\\{X\_{i,j}\\}\right]\\) generated by \\((r+1) \times (r+1)\\)-minors of \\(A\\).)

<div class="exercise">

Let \\(\pi\_{1}: \widetilde{\mathsf{R}}\_{r} \to \Hom(V,W)\\) denote the projection onto the first factor, \\(\pi\_{1}(\varphi, \Lambda) := \varphi\\).  Then \\(\pi\_{1}\\) is a projective morphism, and \\(\pi\_{1}(\widetilde{\mathsf{R}}\_{r}) = \mathsf{R}\_{r}\\).

### Symmetric linear algebra and the geometry of quadric hypersurfaces {#symmetric-linear-algebra-and-the-geometry-of-quadric-hypersurfaces}

Let \\(V\\) be an \\((n+1)\\)-dimensional vector space **_over a ground field \\(\k\\) of characteristic not \\(2\\)._**

Let \\(Q \in \Sym^{2}V^{\vee}\\) be a quadratic form on \\(V\\). Choose a basis \\((v\_{i})\_{i=0, \ldots, n}\\) of \\(V\\), and the corresponding dual basis \\((X\_{i})\\) of \\(V^{\vee}\\).  Then, the quadratic form \\(Q\\) is a homogeneous quadratic polynomial \\(Q(X\_0, \ldots, X\_n)\\), and defines a corresponding quadric hypersurface \\[\mathsf{Q} \subset \P V\\] defined as the vanishing (scheme) of \\(Q\\).

<div class="definition">

The **_rank of \\(Q\\)_** (or **_the rank of \\(\mathsf{Q}\\)_**) is defined to be the rank of the symmetric matrix \\(S(Q)\\).

</div>

<div class="exercise">

1.  The singular locus (scheme) of \\(\mathsf{Q}\\) is a linear space, and is the projectivization of the kernel of the \\((n+1)\times(n+1)\\)-symmetric matrix \\(S(Q)\\).

2.  \\(\mathsf{Q}\\) is smooth if and only if it has full rank (\\(= n+1\\)). In general, \\(\sing(\mathsf{Q}) \subset \P V\\) is a linear space with codimension equal to the rank of \\(\mathsf{Q}\\).

3.  Using the fact that over an algebraically closed field all  symmetric matrices are diagonalizable, show that over such a field (characteristic not = \\(2\\)), every quadric is projectively equivalent to exactly one of the \\((n+1)\\) quadrics from the list:
4.  Suppose \\(\mathsf{Q} \subset \P V\\) is a quadric hypersurface with \\(\dim \sing(\mathsf{Q}) = s \geq 0\\).  Then there is a choice of homogeneous coordinates \\((X\_0, \dots, X\_{n})\\) of \\(V\\) in terms of which \\(\mathsf{Q}\\) has defining equation of the form \\[Q(X\_0, \ldots, X\_n) = \sum\_{i = 0}^{n-s-1}X\_{i}L\_{i}\\] where \\(L\_{i}\\) are linear forms in the variables \\(X\_0, \ldots, X\_{n-s-1}\\), and furthermore such that the common vanishing space of the \\(L\_{i}\\) is the plane \\(X\_0 = \dots = X\_{n-s-1}=0\\).

## The geometry of smooth cubic surfaces {#the-geometry-of-smooth-cubic-surfaces}

The geometry of smooth cubic surfaces is extremely rich and interesting, and constitutes one of the earliest chapters  in classical algebraic geometry.  The first fundamental theorem, due to Cayley and Salmon, is:

<div class="theorem">

A cubic surface \\(X \subset \P^3\\) contains exactly \\(27\\) lines if and only if it is smooth.

</div>

<div class="definition">

Define the **_cubic-line_** incidence correspondence to be the subset \\[\Sigma \subset \P^{19}\_{\cubics} \times \G(1,3)\\] consisting of those pairs \\((X,\ell)\\) where \\(X\\) is a cubic surface and \\(\ell\\) is a line contained in \\(X\\).

</div>

<div class="exercise">

In this exercise, we assume the ground field \\(\k\\) is algebraically closed (arbitrary characteristic).

1.  Prove that \\(\Sigma\\) is a smooth, \\(19\\)-dimensional variety by considering the structure of the second projection \\(\pi\_2:\Sigma \to \G(1,3)\\).
2.  Let \\(L\\) denote the line \\(x\_0 = x\_1 = 0\\).  Show that any cubic \\(X\\) containing \\(L\\) is of the form \\(\V(F)\\) where \\(F = x\_0 \cdot Q\_0 + x\_1 \cdot Q\_1\\), where \\(Q\_i(x\_0,x\_1,x\_2,x\_3)\\) are quadratic forms, and that \\(X\\) is singular at a point \\(p \in L\\) if and only if \\(Q\_0(p) = Q\_1 (p) = 0\\).
3.  Prove that a line \\(L\\) on a cubic surface \\(X\\) admits a non-trivial first order deformation **_within \\(X\\)_** if and only if there is a point \\(p \in L\\) where \\(X\\) is singular.
4.  Prove that if \\(p \in X\\) is a singular point on a cubic surface then there must be a line \\(L \subset X\\) containing \\(p\\).
5.  Conclude that the first projection \\[\pi\_{1}: \Sigma \to \P\_{\cubics}^{19}\\] is unramified at every point of \\(\pi\_{1}^{-1}([X])\\) if and only if \\(X\\) is a smooth cubic surface.
6.  From the **_Theorem on Conservation of Number_**, conclude that _every smooth cubic surface contains the same number of lines as every other smooth cubic, and every singular cubic either contains strictly fewer lines, or infinitely many._
7.  Finally, by considering the particularly beautiful  cubic surface \\(\V(x\_{0}^2x\_{1} + x\_{1}^2x\_{2} + x\_{2}^{2}x\_{3}+ x\_{3}^{2}x\_{0})\\) conclude the theorem of Cayley and Salmon: _A cubic surface contains exactly \\(27\\) lines if and only if it is smooth._ (This cubic, the Clebsch cubic, has lines defined over \\(\Z[\zeta\_{5}]\\), so it might be challenging to find the lines. It is also singular over \\(\mathbb{F}\_{5}\\), which is consistent with the fact that \\(\Z[\zeta\_{5}]\\) is ramified only over \\(5\\).)
