* Affine sets, the Zariski topology, and Hilbert's Nullstellensatz


Affine varieties are the fundamental building blocks of the central objects we study in classical algebraic geometry, /quasi-projective varieties/.  In essence, an affine variety is the  solution set of a system of polynomial equations $$f_1(x_1, \dots, x_n) = f_2(x_1, \dots, x_n) = \dots =f_{m}(x_1, \dots, x_n) = 0$$ with coefficients in some field $\k$. This solution set is made into a geometric object after we introduce  the /Zariski topology/ on it.  Furthermore, two such solutions sets are allowed to communicate with each other only through a restricted class of functions, called /regular maps/.  Setting things up this way allows us to define what it means for two solution sets to be isomorphic, even though they may arise in totally different contexts.  (Much like in group theory, the notion of homomorphism and isomorphism allows us to extract an abstract group from its  various guises.)  An affine variety $X$ is then basically an equivalence class of solution sets under the notion of regular isomorphism.  It turns out that $X$ is uniquely recoverable from the ring of /regular functions/ on it.  This ring is called its  /coordinate ring/, denoted $\k[X]$.  The basic philosophy in affine algebraic geometry is then to translate "geometric notions" about $X$ into ring-theoretic notions about $\k[X]$, thereby supporting our geometric intuitions with rigorous algebra.

The relationship between the originating system of equations and its solution set is cleanest and makes most intuitive sense when the /ground field/ $\k$ is algebraically closed, and the main theorem(s) describing this relationship is Hilbert's Nullstellensatz in its various incarnations. This theorem is the most important piece of commutative algebra allowing us to set up the theory of affine varieties.  Because algebraic geometry is easiest to understand when $\k$ is algebraically closed, we will assume this throughout.  (Later, we will see that the characteristic $0$ situation is especially nice, but for now algebraic closed-ness is all we assume.)

** Affine sets

We begin by defining the central geometric objects of this chapter.

#+begin_definition
1)   */Affine space of dimension $n$ (over $\k$)/*, denoted \[\A^{n}_{\k}\] is the set of $n$ -tuples $p = (p_1, \dots, p_{n})$, $p_{i} \in \k$.
2)   For each $i$, we denote by \[x_{i}: \A^{n}_{\k} \to \A^{1}_{\k}\] the \(i\)-th coordinate function sending $(p_{1}, \dots, p_{n})$ to $p_i$.
3)   If $S \subset \k[x_{1} \dots, x_n]$ is a subset of polynomials, we define the */vanishing set of $S$/* to be
    \[\V(S) = \big\{p \in \A^n_{\k} \mid f(p)=0 \, \textrm{for all}\, f \in S \big\}.\]
4) A subset $U \subset \A^{n}_{\k}$ is a */Zariski open set/* if its complement is $\V(S)$ for some $S \subset \k[x_1, \dots, x_n]$.
5) Conversely, any subset $Z \subset \A^n_{\k}$ of the form $\V(S)$ is called a */Zariski closed/* (or, simply */closed/*) subset. A Zariski closed subset of affine space also called an */affine (or algebraic) set/*.
6) More generally, if $Z \subset \A^n_{\k}$ is an algebraic set, then a subset $U \subset Z$ is  a */Zariski open  subset of $Z$/* if $U$ is the intersection of $Z$ with a Zarski open subset of $\A^n_{\k}$.
7) A Zariski open subset of an algebraic set is called a */quasi-affine set/*. 
#+end_definition

It is immediate that if $S \subset \k[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ is any subset, and if $I$ is the ideal generated by $S$, then $\V(S) = \V(I)$.  So, our focus quickly moves to ideals in $\k[x_1, \dots, x_n]$.  The following exercise justifies the use of the words "closed/open."  


#+begin_exercise
Suppose $I,J \subset \k[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ are two ideals. Show:
1)  \(\V(I \cdot J) = \V(I) \cup \V(J)\), and
2)  \(\V(I+J) = \V(I) \cap \V(J).\)
3)  Prove that two distinct ideals $I$ and $J$ can satisfy $\V(I) = \V(J)$, and moreover, there exists an example where neither $I \subset J$ nor $J \subset I$.
4)  Prove that the Zariski open subsets of $\A^{n}_{\k}$ satisfy the axioms of a topology. This topology is called the */Zariski topology on $\A^n_{\k}$./*
5)   Prove that the Zariski closed, proper subsets of $\A^{1}_{\k}$ are precisely the finite subsets.
6)   Prove that every finite subset of $\A^{n}_{\k}$ is closed, but that the converse is false when $n \geq 2$.
7)  If $Z \subset \A^n_{\k}$ is an affine set, prove that the subsets of $Z$ which are closed in $\A^n_{\k}$ satisfy the axioms satisfied by closed sets in a topology. This is called the */Zariski topology on $Z$./*
#+end_exercise

In light of this exercise, in order to create an algebraic set, we need only consider $\V(I)$'s for /ideals/ $I \subset \k[x_1, \dots,
x_n]$.    Whenever we say "open" or "closed", we refer to the Zariski topology. 


The beauty in classical algebraic geometry is only seen through its countless, interesting examples.   Certain examples are more educational than others and have special names.  Here are a few to start:



#+begin_eg
 1)  The /parabola/ \[\V(y-x^{2}) \subset \A^{2}_{\k}.\] 
 2)  The /quadric cone/ \[\V(xy-z^2) \subset \A^3_{\k}.\]
 3)  An  /affine quadric surface/ \[\V(xy-z) \subset \A^{3}_{\k}.\]
 4)  The /nodal cubic/ \[\V(y^2 - x^{2}-x^{3}) \subset \A^2_{\k}.\] 
 5) The /cuspidal cubic/ \[\V(y^2-x^3) \subset \A^2_{\k}.\]
 6)  A particular  /elliptic curve/ \[\V(y^2-x^3+x) \subset \A^2_{\k}.\]
 7)  The /affine twisted cubic/ \[\V(x^2-y,x^3-z) = \V(x^2-y, xy-z) \subset \A^3_{\k}.\]
 8)  The /Whitney umbrella/ \[\V(x^2+zy^2) \subset \A^{3}_{\k}.\]
    
[[./images/whitney2.png]]

 9) A /line and a plane/  \[\V(xz,yz) \subset \A^3_{\k}.\]
#+end_eg

*** Pictures

In the list of examples above, what do those pictures mean?  Clearly they are real images, meaning they exist in $\A^2_{\R}$ or $\A^{3}_{\R}$. But this is not our true context: we've assumed $\k$ is algebraically closed!  Unfortunately, it is not possible to draw a true representation in this case, so we refer to these sorts of images as "real cartoons."   

*** Operations $\V$ and $\I$

The operation $\V$ is a surjective  function: \[\V(-): \big\{\,\textrm{ideals in} \,\,  \k[x_1, \dots, x_n] \big\} \to \big\{\,\textrm{affine subsets of} \,\,  \A^{n}_{\k} \big\}.\]

But we can also go backwards, from sets to ideals:

#+begin_definition
Let $Z \subset \A^n_{\k}$ be any subset.  We define the */ideal of $Z$/* to be \[\I(Z) = \big\{ f \in \k[x_1,\dots,x_n] \mid f(z)=0\,\, \textrm{for all}\,\,z \in Z \big\}.\]
#+end_definition

And so, $\I$ defines a function:
 \[\I(-): \big\{\,\textrm{affine subsets of} \,\,  \A^{n}_{\k} \big\} \to \big\{\,\textrm{ideals in}  \subset \k[x_1, \dots, x_n] \big\}.\]

$\I(-)$ satisfies some obvious properties, for example if $Z_1 \subset Z_2$ is a proper containment of affine subsets, then we get a strict, opposite containment of ideals $\I(Z_2) \supset \I(Z_1)$. 



#+begin_eg
Let $p = (p_1, \dots, p_n) \in \A^n_{\k}$ be any point. Then $\I(\{p\}) = (x_1-p_1, \dots, x_n-p_n)$. Notice that $I(\{p\}) \subset \k[x_1,\dots, x_n]$ is a /maximal ideal/.  So, we typically use the symbol $\fm_p$ for this ideal.
#+end_eg



Since $\V$ and $\I$ point in opposite directions, it's natural to wonder that their compositions (both ways) are.  One composition, found in the next exercise, is easy to understand.  The other composition leads naturally to  Hilbert's Nullstellansatz, and so we postpone it.

#+begin_exercise
1)  Prove: For any subset $Z \subset \A^{n}_{\k}$, we have $Z \subset \V(\I(Z))$.
2)  Prove:  $Z \subset \A^n_{\k}$ is Zariski-closed if and only if $Z = \V(\I(Z))$.
3)  In fact, prove: For any $Z \subset \A^n_{\k}$, $\V(\I(Z))$ is the closure of $Z$ under the Zariski topology on $\A^n_{\k}$.
#+end_exercise




*** Prime ideals and irreducible affine sets

Affine sets have "main, atomic pieces," called /irreducible components/.   This requires that we define the notion of /reducibility/, which we elaborate on here.

#+begin_definition
An affine set $Z$ is */reducible/* if it is the union of two non-empty, proper closed subsets. Otherwise, $Z$ is said to be */irreducible/*.  More generally, a topological space $X$ is */reducible/* if it is the union of two non-empty, proper closed subsets, and is */irreducible/* otherwise.

If $X$ is any topological space, then a subset $Y \subset X$ is called an */irreducible component/* of $X$ if $Y$ is maximal among closed, irreducible subsets of $X$. 
#+end_definition

#+begin_exercise
1) Prove: Any two non-empty open subsets of an irreducible topological space must intersect.
2) Prove: If $U \subset X$ is a non-empty open set in an irreducible topological space $X$, then $X$ is the closure of $U$, i.e. $U$ is dense in $X$.
#+end_exercise

For affine sets, irreducibility has a nice algebraic interpretation. 

#+begin_proposition
An affine set $Z \subset \A^{n}_{\k}$ is irreducible if and only if $\I(Z) \subset \k[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ is a prime ideal.
#+end_proposition


*** Algebra: Hilbert's Nullstellensatz

Our first fundamental  theorem, which appears in several different forms in several different levels of generality, explains the relationship between the operations $\V(-)$ and $\I(-)$.  The exact message of Hilbert's Nullstellensatz can be confusing for newcomers, so I'll try to give many different viewpoints here.

1) When $\k$ is algebraically closed, the Nullstellensatz tells us that the only way for $\V(I)$ to be empty is if $I = (1)$, the unit ideal. In other words, any system of polynomial equations which is not equivalent to $1=0$ */must have/* solutions in $\A^n_{\k}$.
2) When $\k$ is algebraically closed, the Nullstellensatz provides the precise list of /maximal ideals in/ $\k[x_1, \dots, x_n]$. 

#+begin_theorem
Let $\k$ be an arbitrary field.

1) If $L$ is a finitely generated \(\k\)-algebra which is also a field, then $L$ is a finite field extension of $\k$.

2) A polynomial system of equations \(\big\{f_1=0, f_2=0, \dots, f_m =0 \big\}\) with $f_i \in \k[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ has a solution in */some/* \(\k\)-algebra if and only if it has a solution $(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n)$ where each $\alpha_i$ is algebraic over $\k$. 

3) If \(\k\) is algebraically closed, then every maximal ideal of \(\,\,\k[x_1, \dots, x_n]\) is of the form $(x_1-p_1, \dots, x_n-p_n)$ for some $p_i \in \k$.

4) If \(\k\) is algebraically closed, and if $I \subset \k[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ satisfies $\V(I) = \emptyset$, then $I = (1)$, the unit ideal.
5) If \(\k\) is algebraically closed, and if $\fp \subset \k[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ is a prime ideal, then $\I(\V(\fp)) = \fp$.
#+end_theorem


#+begin_exercise
Let \(\k[x]\) denote the polynomial ring in one variable, and suppose \(f_1, \dots, f_m \in \k[x]\) are finitely many polynomials.  Prove that the ring \(\k[x, \frac{1}{f_1}, \dots, \frac{1}{f_m}]\) is never a field. 
#+end_exercise



** Regular functions

Next, we must set the rules for how algebraic sets and quasi-affine sets are allowed to communicate with each other.  This will also allow us to talk about a quasi-affine set without reference to an ambient $\A^{n}_{\k}$.   In short, we allow ourselves only  to use functions which are locally describable using ratios of polynomial functions.  These functions are called /regular functions/. 

#+begin_definition
Let $U \subset \A^{n}_{\k}$ be a quasi-affine set.
1) Let $z \in U$ be a point. A function $f: U \to \A^1_{\k}$ is */regular/* at $z$ if: there exists an open set $V \subset U$ containing $z$ and an element $p/q \in \k(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ defined on $V$ such that $f|_{V}$ agrees with $p/q$ on $V$. We say $f: U \to \A^{1}_{\k}$ is regular if it is regular at every point $z \in U$.  The set of regular functions $U \to \A^1_{\k}$ is naturally a \(\k\)-algebra, and we denote it by $\k[U]$. 
2) A map $\varphi = (f_1, \dots, f_m): U \to \A^m_{\k}$ is */regular/* if each coordinate function $f_i$ is in $\k[U]$.
3) If $U' \subset \A^{m}_{\k}$ is another quasi-affine set then a function  $\varphi: U \to V$ is */regular/* if the composite $U \to U' \hookrightarrow  \A^m_{\k}$ is regular as in part (2).
4) Two quasi-affine sets $U \subset \A^{n}_{\k}$, $U' \subset \A^{m}_{\k}$ are /isomorphic/ if there exist regular mappings $\varphi: U \to U'$, $\varphi': U' \to U$  which compose to identity both ways.
#+end_definition



It would be nice if this restricted class of functions behaved well with respect to other choices we've made.  For instance, it comes as a relief that:

#+begin_proposition
Regular functions and mappings are continuous for the Zariski topology.
#+end_proposition

#+begin_proof
In class.  (Then I'll put it here.)
#+end_proof



#+begin_exercise
Let $\varphi: U \to U'$ be a regular mapping between quasi-affine sets.  Prove:
1) If $g \in \k[U']$  then $g \circ \varphi \in \k[U]$.
2) The formula $g \mapsto g \circ \varphi$ defines a \(\k\)-algebra homomorphism $\k[U'] \to \k[U]$.  (This homomorphism is denoted \(\varphi^{\sharp}\).)
3) Without using anything later in the text, calculate $\k[\A^{1}_{\k}]$. 
#+end_exercise

After doing the previous exercise, one sees that the composition of regular mappings is again regular.  



If $U \subset \A^{n}_{\k}$ is a quasi-affine set, then there is a very quick way to produce regular functions on $U$: restrict a polynomial $f(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ to $U$. Therefore, we always have a ring homomorphism $\k[x_1, \dots, x_n] \to \k[U]$.  Secondly, clearly if $f \in \I(U)$, then $f$ restricts to the zero function $0 \in \k[U]$.  Therefore, restriction of polynomials induces a homomorphism \[\k[x_1, \dots, x_n]/\I(U) \to \k[U].\]  One fundamental use of the Nullstellensatz provides great news in the case that $U \subset \A^{n}_{\k}$ is /affine/. 


#+begin_theorem
Let $Z \subset \A^n_{\k}$ be an affine set. Then every regular function on $Z$ is the restriction of a polynomial in $\k[x_1, \dots, x_n]$, and, the restriction homomorphism $\k[x_1, \dots, x_n]/\I(Z) \to \k[Z]$ is an isomorphism. 
#+end_theorem

#+begin_proof
In class first, then I'll put here.
#+end_proof

This is why, when $Z \subset \A^{n}_{\k}$ is affine, the ring of regular functions $\k[Z]$ is called the /coordinate ring/ of $Z$ -- it just turns out to be the algebra of functions obtained by playing around with only the coordinate functions $x_1, \dots, x_n$ restricted to $Z$.

#+begin_exercise
Let $Z \subset \A^n_{\k}$ be an algebraic subset, and let $f \in \k[x_0, \dots, x_n]$ be any polynomial.  If $\varphi: Z_f \to \A^1_{\k}$ is a regular function then there exists a polynomial $a$ such that $p = a/f^{m}$ for some $m \geq 0$. 
#+end_exercise

** The various rings attached to an affine set
*** The ring \(\O(U)\) for an open set \(U \subset X\)
*** The local ring \(\O_{X,p}\)  attached to point \(p \in X\)
#+begin_definition
Let \(p \in X\) be a point on an algebraic set $X$.  We define the /local ring of \(X\) at \(p\)/ , denoted \(\O_{X,p}\), to be the ring consisting of regular functions defined on some open neighborhood of \(p\).
#+end_definition

#+begin_exercise
1) Let \(X = \V(y^2-x)\), and let \(p = (4,2)\). Draw a real cartoon of the situation.  Prove that \(\O_{X,p}\) is a principal ideal domain.

2) Let \(Y = \V(y^2-x^2-x^3)\), and let \(p=(0,0)\). Draw a real cartoon of the situation. Prove that \(\O_{Y,p}\) is not a principal ideal domain.

3) Let \(Z = \A^{2}_{\k}\), and let \(p \in Z\) be any point. Draw a real cartoon of the situation. Prove that \(\O_{Z,p}\) is not a principal ideal domain.
#+end_exercise

* Projective space $\P^n_{\k}$ and projective varieties
For a multitude of reasons, it is useful to want to /compactify/ affine space.  Take, for instance, the concept of the /slope of a line/ from high school algebra.  Slopes were numbers, typically labelled $m$.  Except, hold on, what about those pesky "vertical" lines?  It is clear that, geometrically, vertical lines are no more special than any other kind of line.  So we should extend the concept of slope $m$ to include an "infinity" slope $m =\infty$. By adding $\infty$ to the $\A^1$ of slopes, we arrive at the /projective line/ $\P^1$.

Another way that projective space arises is in the following context:  We have a vector space $V$, but we only really care  about elements of $V$ /up to scaling/.  For instance, if we only care about the /location of the roots/ of a quadratic polynomial $ax^2+bx+c$, then for our purposes there is no difference between polynomials $ax^2+bx+c$ and $\lambda a x^2 + \lambda b x + \lambda c =0$, where $\lambda$ a nonzero number.
** Projective varieties
For simplicity, we work throughout over an algebraically closed field \(\k\).

#+begin_definition
1) The \(n\)-dimensional projective space, denoted \(\P^n_{\k}\), is the set of equivalence classes of points of $\left(\A^{n+1}_{\k}\right)^{\times}$ under the action of $\k^{\times}$ by scaling.
2)  A point $p \in  \P^n_{\k}$ is denoted by a tuple $[p_0 : p_1 : \ldots : p_n]$, and two tuples $[p_0 : p_1 : \ldots : p_n]$ and $[q_0 : q_1 : \dots : q_n]$ represent the same point in $\P^n_{\k}$ if and only if there exists $\lambda \in \k^{\times}$ such that $p_i = \lambda q_i$ for all $i = 0,\ldots, n$.
3) The assignment $(p_0, \dots, p_n) \mapsto [p_0 : \dots : p_n]$ defines the */quotient mapping/* \[\q : \left( \A^{n+1}_{\k}\right)^{\times} \to \P^n_{\k}.\]
4) The */Zariski topology on \(\P^n_{\k}\)/* is defined as follows: A subset $U \subset \P^n_{\k}$ is open (resp. closed) if and only if $\q^{-1}(U)$ is Zariski-open (resp. closed) in  \(\left( \A^{n+1}_{\k}\right)^{\times}\).
5) For each $i=0, \ldots, n$, we define the */\(i\)-th standard affine open chart of $\P^n_{\k}$/* to be the open set \[U_{i} = \big\{ [p_{0}: \ldots : p_n] \mid p_i \neq 0 \big\}.\]
#+end_definition

#+begin_exercise
1) For each $i=0,\ldots, n$, let $\gamma_i: \A^{n}_{\k} \to U_i$ denote the bijective function that sends $(a_0, \ldots, a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}, \ldots a_n)$ to the point $[a_0: \ldots: a_{i-1} : 1 : a_{i+1} : \ldots : a_n]$.  Prove that $\gamma_i$ is a /homeomorphism/ of topological spaces, meaning: $Y \subset \A^n_{\k}$ is Zariski-open if and only if $\gamma_i(Y) \subset U_i$ is Zariski-open.
2) One could define another topology on $\P^n_{\k}$ in the following way: A set $Y \subset \P^n_{\k}$ is closed if and only if $Y_{i} := Y \cap U_i$ is closed in $U_i$ for all $i$, where we think of $U_i$ as an affine space under the indentifications $\gamma_i$ in the previous exercise.  Prove that this topology is the same as the Zariski topology defined in the definition above.
#+end_exercise


#+begin_theorem
Every closed subset of  \(\P^{n}_{\k}\) is obtained as the vanishing set of a graded ideal in $\k[X_0, \dots, X_n]$. 
#+end_theorem
** Projective morphisms
#+begin_theorem
The main theorem of elimination theory.
#+end_theorem 
** Morphisms between projective spaces

#+begin_definition
Let $X, Y$ be two varieties, with $X$ irreducible. A */rational map/* from $X$ to $Y$, is an equivalence class of pairs $(\varphi, U)$ where:
1) $U \subset X$ is a non-empty open set, and $\varphi: U \to Y$ is a regular map, and
2) Two pairs $(\varphi, U)$ and $(\xi, V)$ are equivalent if there exists an open subset $W \subset U \cap V$ where $\varphi|_{W} = \xi|_{W}$. 
#+end_definition

#+begin_proposition
Let $\varphi: X \dashrightarrow Y$ be a rational map.  Then there exists a maximal domain of definition, $U_{\textrm{max}} \subset X$ for $\varphi$, i.e. if $(\xi,U)$ represents $\varphi$ then $U \subset U_{\textrm{max}}$. 
#+end_proposition

(Proof: For all representatives $(\xi_{\alpha}, U_{\alpha})$ representing $\varphi$, define $U_{\textrm{max}}$ to be the union of all $U_\alpha$. Suppose $(\xi_{\alpha}, U_{\alpha})$ and $(\xi_{\beta}, U_{\beta})$ both represent $\varphi$. Then $U_{\alpha} \cap U_{\beta}$ is an irreducible quasi-projective variety.  The two regular maps $\xi_{\alpha}|_{U_{\alpha} \cap U_{\beta}}$ and $\xi_{\beta}|_{U_{\alpha} \cap U_{\beta}}$ agree on an open set, and therefore agree everywhere.  Thus the $\xi_{\alpha}$'s glue together to produce a regular map on $U_{\textrm{max}}$, which is what we needed.)


#+begin_theorem
Every regular mapping $\varphi: \P^n_{\k} \to \P^m_{\k}$ is of the form $[x_0, \dots, x_n] \mapsto [F_0: \ldots : F_m]$ for some homogeneous forms $F_{i}$ of the same degree, not all sharing a common zero.
#+end_theorem

#+begin_theorem
Every regular automorphism of $\P^n_{\k}$ is a linear change of variables.
#+end_theorem

* Tangent spaces
To each point $x$ on a variety $X$ we attach a \(k\)-vector space $T_{X,x}$, called the */Zariski tangent space/*.   This vector space unlocks the concept of */smoothness/* of $X$ at $x$, which is the  algebro-geometric formulation of the intuition that $X$ appears ``locally linear" around $x$. 


#+begin_definition
Let $x \in X$ be a point on a variety.  The */Zariski tangent space of $X$ at $x$/*, denoted $T_{X,x}$, is the \(\k\)-vector space \[\left( {\fm_{x}}/{\fm_{x}^2} \right)^{\vee}.\]
#+end_definition

The ring $\k[\varepsilon]/(\varepsilon^2)$ provides a sometimes-useful alternate interpretation of the Zariski tangent space.  This is encoded in the following critical exercise. 

#+begin_exercise
Let $x \in X$ be a point on a variety. Then there is a canonical identification between $T_{X,x}$ and the set of \(\k\)-algebra homomorphisms $\phi : \O_{X,x} \to \k[\varepsilon]/(\varepsilon^2)$ which send $\fm_{x}$ into the ideal $(\varepsilon)$.

** Singular points and smooth points

** The nature of the local ring at a smooth point

** Bertini's theorem(s) 

#+begin_theorem
Let $f: X \to \P^n_{\k}$ be a map from a smooth, quasi-projective variety $X$ to a projective space, and suppose $\k$ is a */perfect/*, algebraically closed field.  If $H \subset \P^n_{\k}$ is a Zariski-general hyperplane, then $f^{-1}(H) \subset X$ is a smooth divisor.
#+end_theorem




* Constancy of number

#+begin_theorem
Let $f: X \to Y$ be a finite map, with $X$ and $Y$ smooth, irreducible affine varieties over a characteristic zero field. Then the length of every fiber is equal to the degree of $f$. (Degree of extension fields.)
#+end_theorem



* Hypersurfaces

Let $X = \V(F) \subset \P^n_{\k}$ be a hypersurface, defined by a degree $d$ homogeneous form $F(x_0, \dots, x_n)$.   Let \(p = (p_0, \ldots, p_n) \in \left( \A^{n+1} \right)^{\times}\) be a point such that $F(p) = 0$, and let $\hat{X} \subset  \A^{n+1}$ denote the affine cone over $X$.  Then $X$ is singular at $[p]$ if and only if $\hat{X}$ is singular at $p$. 
* Basics on vector bundles
** The definition of a vector bundle
The concept of a */vector bundle/* is ubiquitous in mathematics, and captures the idea of a "family of vector spaces parametrized by a base space."  In algebraic geometry, the definition is as follows:
#+begin_definition
Let $X$ be a variety.  A */rank $r$ vector bundle over \(X\)/* is a variety $\E$ together with a regular map $\pi: \E \to X$ such that:
- There is an open covering $\{U_{\alpha}\}$ of $X$  and isomorphisms $\phi_{\alpha}: \pi^{-1}(U_{\alpha}) \to U_{\alpha}\times \A^r_{\k}$ TODO

** Line bundles

** Rank-dropping varieties

Suppose $V$ and $W$ are \(\k\)-vector spaces of dimensions $n$, and $m$ respectively.  In this document we will establish fundamental facts about the geometry of a particularly ubiquitous stratification of the vector space of linear homomorphisms \[\Hom(V,W)\]


#+begin_definition
 For each integer $r \leq m$, we define the subset $$\mathsf{R}_{r} \subset \Hom(V,W)$$ as the collection of homomorphisms $\varphi: V \to W$ having rank $\leq r$.  Furthermore, let $$\mathring{\mathsf{R}}_{r} = \mathsf{R}_{r}\setminus \mathsf{R}_{r-1}$$ be the set of homomorphisms of rank $r$.
 #+end_definition


On the extremes, \(\mathsf{R}_m = \Hom(V,W)\) and \(\mathsf{R}_{0} = \{0\}\).  After choosing bases of $V$ and $W$, every element of $\Hom(V,W)$ is represented by a $m \times n$ matrix. Let us write the */universal $m \times n$ matrix/* as 
\[A = \big\{ x_{ij} \big\} \,\,\,  1 \leq i \leq m, 1 \leq j \leq n.\]
Linear algebra says: 

For each $r$, the subset $\mathsf{R}_{r}$ is the common vanishing locus of all determinants of $(r+1) \times (r+1)$ minors of the universal matrix $A$.

Thus, $\mathsf{R}_{r}$ is a sub-variety of $\Hom(V,W)$.  (In fact, it comes with a "usual" scheme structure given by the ideal in $\k\left[\{X_{i,j}\}\right]$ generated by \((r+1) \times (r+1)\)-minors of $A$.) 



#+begin_exercise 
In light of the canonical identification between $\Hom(V,W)$ and $\Hom(W^{\vee},V^{\vee})$, why is it enough to study the situation where $n \leq m$?
#+end_exercise


#+begin_exercise
Let $I_{r} \subset \k[\{ x_{ij}\}]$ denote the ideal generated by the determinants of the $(r+1) \times (r+1)$ minors of $A$.  Prove that $I_{r-1}$ is generated by all partial derivatives of all elements in the ideal $I_{r}$.
#+end_exercise


In the language of schemes, this translates to: /\(\mathsf{R_{r-1}}\) is
the singular scheme of \(\mathsf{R_{r}}\)./






#+begin_exercise
Examine the geometry of the subvarieties $\mathsf{R}_{r}$ when $m=n=2$.

*** The relevant incidence variety
For each $1 \leq r \leq m$ we define the subset 
\[\widetilde{\mathsf{R}}_{r} \subset \Hom(V,W) \times \Gr(n-r,V)\] as the set of pairs $(\varphi, \Lambda)$  satisfying  \[ \Lambda \subset \ker \varphi.\]


Let $\pi_{1}: \widetilde{\mathsf{R}}_{r} \to \Hom(V,W)$ denote the projection onto the first factor, $\pi_{1}(\varphi, \Lambda) := \varphi$.  Then $\pi_{1}$ is a projective morphism, and $\pi_{1}(\widetilde{\mathsf{R}}_{r}) = \mathsf{R}_{r}$.


#+begin_exercise
1) Prove, using standard affine charts on the \(\Gr(n-r,V)\), that $\widetilde{\mathsf{R}}_{r}$ is a closed subvariety of \(\Hom(V,W) \times \Gr(n-r,V).\)  For a follow-up exercise, show it is irreducible.
2) Prove that $\pi_{1}: \widetilde{\mathsf{R}}_{r} \to \mathsf{R}_{r}$ is an isomorphism over $\mathring{\mathsf{R}}_{r}$.
3) (\(\varepsilon\)asy  with \(\varepsilon\)-skills.) Let $(\varphi, \Lambda)$ denote an arbitrary point of $\widetilde{\mathsf{R}}_{r}$. Then the tangent space of $\widetilde{\mathsf{R}}_{r}$ at $(\varphi, \Lambda)$ is the subspace of   $Hom(V,W) \oplus Hom(\Lambda, V/\Lambda)$ consisting of pairs $(\psi,\alpha)$ such that \[\overline{\varphi} \circ \alpha + \psi|_{\Lambda} = 0\] as elements of $Hom(\Lambda, W)$.  Here, $\overline{\varphi}: V /\Lambda \to W$ is the map induced by $\varphi$.
#+end_exercise

The conclusion from all exercises above is: 

#+begin_theorem
 Theorem on the Geometry of Rank-Dropping: 
1. The variety $\widetilde{\mathsf{R}}_{r}$ is smooth and irreducible.
2. The map $\pi_{1}: \widetilde{\mathsf{R}}_{r} \to \mathsf{R}_{r}$ is an isomorphism precisely over  $\mathring{\mathsf{R}}_{r}$.  Hence, $\mathsf{R}_{r}$ is irreducible, and has codimension $(n-r)(m-r)$ in $\Hom(V,W)$.
3. $\sing(\mathsf{R}_{r}) = \mathsf{R}_{r-1}$.

** Symmetric linear algebra and the geometry of quadric hypersurfaces

Let $V$ be an \((n+1)\)-dimensional vector space */over a ground field $\k$ of characteristic not $2$./*

Let $Q \in \Sym^{2}V^{\vee}$ be a quadratic form on $V$. Choose a basis $(v_{i})_{i=0, \ldots, n}$ of $V$, and the corresponding dual basis $(X_{i})$ of $V^{\vee}$.  Then, the quadratic form $Q$ is a homogeneous quadratic polynomial $Q(X_0, \ldots, X_n)$, and defines a corresponding quadric hypersurface $$\mathsf{Q} \subset \P V$$ defined as the vanishing (scheme) of $Q$.


#+begin_definition
The */rank of $Q$/* (or */the rank of $\mathsf{Q}$/*) is defined to be the rank of the symmetric matrix \(S(Q)\).
#+end_definition


#+begin_exercise 
1) The singular locus (scheme) of $\mathsf{Q}$ is a linear space, and is the projectivization of the kernel of the \((n+1)\times(n+1)\)-symmetric matrix $S(Q)$.
   
2) $\mathsf{Q}$ is smooth if and only if it has full rank ($= n+1$). In general, $\sing(\mathsf{Q}) \subset \P V$ is a linear space with codimension equal to the rank of $\mathsf{Q}$.

3) Using the fact that over an algebraically closed field all  symmetric matrices are diagonalizable, show that over such a field (characteristic not = $2$), every quadric is projectively equivalent to exactly one of the $(n+1)$ quadrics from the list: 
4) Suppose $\mathsf{Q} \subset \P V$ is a quadric hypersurface with $\dim \sing(\mathsf{Q}) = s \geq 0$.  Then there is a choice of homogeneous coordinates $(X_0, \dots, X_{n})$ of $V$ in terms of which $\mathsf{Q}$ has defining equation of the form $$Q(X_0, \ldots, X_n) = \sum_{i = 0}^{n-s-1}X_{i}L_{i}$$ where $L_{i}$ are linear forms in the variables $X_0, \ldots, X_{n-s-1}$, and furthermore such that the common vanishing space of the $L_{i}$ is the plane $X_0 = \dots = X_{n-s-1}=0$.
\[X_{0}^{2},\,\,\, X_{0}^2+X_{1}^2,\,\, \ldots\,\,\,, X_{0}^{2} + X_{1}^2 + \cdots +X_{n}^{2}.\]

* The geometry of smooth cubic surfaces
The geometry of smooth cubic surfaces is extremely rich and interesting, and constitutes one of the earliest chapters  in classical algebraic geometry.  The first fundamental theorem, due to Cayley and Salmon, is: 

#+begin_theorem 
A cubic surface $X \subset \P^3$ contains exactly $27$ lines if and only if it is smooth. 
#+end_theorem


#+begin_definition
Define the */cubic-line/* incidence correspondence to be the subset \[\Sigma \subset \P^{19}_{\cubics} \times \G(1,3)\] consisting of those pairs $(X,\ell)$ where $X$ is a cubic surface and $\ell$ is a line contained in $X$.
#+end_definition

#+begin_exercise
In this exercise, we assume the ground field $\k$ is algebraically closed (arbitrary characteristic). 
1) Prove that $\Sigma$ is a smooth, \(19\)-dimensional variety by considering the structure of the second projection $\pi_2:\Sigma \to \G(1,3)$.
2) Let $L$ denote the line $x_0 = x_1 = 0$.  Show that any cubic $X$ containing $L$ is of the form $\V(F)$ where $F = x_0 \cdot Q_0 + x_1 \cdot Q_1$, where $Q_i(x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3)$ are quadratic forms, and that $X$ is singular at a point $p \in L$ if and only if $Q_0(p) = Q_1 (p) = 0$.
3) Prove that a line $L$ on a cubic surface $X$ admits a non-trivial first order deformation */within $X$/* if and only if there is a point $p \in L$ where $X$ is singular.  
4) Prove that if $p \in X$ is a singular point on a cubic surface then there must be a line $L \subset X$ containing $p$. 
5) Conclude that the first projection \[\pi_{1}: \Sigma \to \P_{\cubics}^{19}\] is unramified at every point of $\pi_{1}^{-1}([X])$ if and only if $X$ is a smooth cubic surface.  
6) From the */Theorem on Conservation of Number/*, conclude that /every smooth cubic surface contains the same number of lines as every other smooth cubic, and every singular cubic either contains strictly fewer lines, or infinitely many./
7) Finally, by considering the particularly beautiful  cubic surface $\V(x_{0}^2x_{1} + x_{1}^2x_{2} + x_{2}^{2}x_{3}+ x_{3}^{2}x_{0})$ conclude the theorem of Cayley and Salmon: /A cubic surface contains exactly $27$ lines if and only if it is smooth./ (This cubic, the Clebsch cubic, has lines defined over $\Z[\zeta_{5}]$, so it might be challenging to find the lines. It is also singular over $\mathbb{F}_{5}$, which is consistent with the fact that $\Z[\zeta_{5}]$ is ramified only over $5$.)
